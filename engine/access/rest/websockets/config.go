	// PingPeriod defines the interval at which ping messages are sent to the client.

	// timeout elapses. Each new pong message resets the server's read deadline, keeping the connection alive as long as
	// the client is responsive.
	//
	// Example:
	// At t=9, the server sends a ping, initial read deadline is t=10 (for the first message)
	// At t=10, the client responds with a pong. The server resets its read deadline to t=20.
	// At t=18, the server sends another ping. If the client responds with a pong at t=19, the read deadline is extended to t=29.
	//
	// In case of failure:
	// If the client stops responding, the server will send a ping at t=9 but won't receive a pong by t=10. The server then closes the connection.

	// isn't completed within this duration, it fails with a timeout error.
	// SetWriteDeadline ensures the write operation does not block indefinitely

	// and allows the server to gracefully handle timeouts for delayed writes.
