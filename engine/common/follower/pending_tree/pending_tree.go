// PendingTree is a mempool holding certified blocks that eventually might be connected to the finalized state.
// As soon as a valid fork of certified blocks descending from the latest finalized block is observed,
// we pass this information to caller. Internally, the mempool utilizes the LevelledForest.
// PendingTree is NOT safe to use in concurrent environment.
// Note:
//   - The ability to skip ahead is irrelevant for staked nodes, which continuously follow the chain.
//     However, light clients don't necessarily follow the chain block by block. Assume a light client
//     that knows the EpochCommit event, i.e. the consensus committee authorized to certify blocks. A
//     staked node can easily ship a proof of finalization for a block within that epoch to such a
//     light client. This would be much cheaper for the light client than downloading the headers for
//     all blocks in the epoch.
//   - The pending tree supports skipping ahead, as this is a more general and simpler algorithm.
//     Removing the ability to skip ahead would restrict the PendingTree's domain of potential
//     applications _and_ would require additional code and additional tests making it more complex.
//
// Outlook:
//   - At the moment, PendingTree relies on notion of a `Certified Block` which is a valid block accompanied
//     by a certifying QC (proving block validity). This works well for consensus follower, as it is designed
//     to work with certified blocks.
//   - In the future, we could use the PendingTree also for consensus participants. Therefore, we would need
//     to abstract out CertifiedBlock or replace it with a generic argument that satisfies some contract
//     (returns View, Height, BlockID). Then, consensus participants could use the Pending Tree without
//     QCs and instead fully validate inbound blocks (incl. payloads) to guarantee block validity.

// AddBlocks accepts a batch of certified blocks, adds them to the tree of pending blocks and finds blocks connected to

//  1. the subset of `certifiedBlocks` that are connected to the finalized block
//     - excluding any blocks whose view is smaller or equal to the finalized block

// consistent with the current state. While repetitive inputs might cause repetitive outputs, the implementation
// has some general heuristics to avoid extra work:
//   - It drops blocks whose view is smaller or equal to the finalized block
//   - It deduplicates incoming blocks. We don't store additional vertices in tree if we have that block already stored.

// FinalizeFork takes last finalized block and prunes all blocks below the finalized view.
// PendingTree treats its input as a potentially repetitive stream of information: repeated
// and older inputs (out of order) are already consistent with the current state. Repetitive
// inputs might cause repetitive outputs.
// When a block is finalized we don't care for any blocks below it, since they were already finalized.
// Finalizing a block might causes the pending PendingTree to detect _additional_ blocks as now
// being connected to the latest finalized block. This happens if some connecting blocks are missing
// and then a block higher than the missing blocks is finalized.
// In the following example, B is the last finalized block known to the PendingTree
//
//	A ← B  ←-?-?-?-- X ← Y ← Z
//
// The network has already progressed to finalizing block X. However, the interim blocks denoted
// by '←-?-?-?--' have not been received by our PendingTree. Therefore, we still consider X,Y,Z
// as disconnected. If the PendingTree tree is now informed that X is finalized, it can fast-
// forward to the respective state, as it anyway would prune all the blocks below X.
// Note:
//   - The ability to skip ahead is irrelevant for staked nodes, which continuously follows the chain.
