// TestVerificationHappyPath evaluates behavior of the pipeline of verification node engines as:
// block reader -> block consumer -> assigner engine -> chunks queue -> chunks consumer -> fetcher engine -> verifier engine
// block reader receives (container) finalized blocks that contain execution receipts preceding (reference) blocks.
// some receipts have duplicate results.
// - in a authorized verification node:
// -- in assigner engine, for each distinct result it receives:
// --- it does the chunk assignment.
// --- it passes the chunk locators of assigned chunks to chunk queue.
// --- the chunk queue in turn delivers the assigned chunk to the fetcher engine.
// -- in fetcher engine, for each arriving chunk locator:
// --- it asks the chunk data pack from requester engine.
// --- requester engine asks and retrieves chunk data pack from (mocked) execution node.
// --- once chunk data pack arrives, forms a verifiable chunk and passes it to verifier node.
// -- in verifier engine, for each arriving verifiable chunk:
// --- it verifies the chunk, shapes a result approval, and emits it to (mock) consensus node.
// -- the test is passed if (mock) consensus node receives a single result approval per assigned chunk in a timely manner.
// - in an unauthorized verification node:
// -- execution results are discarded.
// -- the test is passed if no result approval is emitted for any of the chunks in a timely manner.
