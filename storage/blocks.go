// Blocks provides persistent storage for blocks.
//
// Conceptually, blocks must always be signed by the proposer. Once a block is certified (i.e.
// received votes from a supermajority of consensus participants, in their aggregated form
// represented by the Quorum Certificate [QC]), the proposer's signature is included in the QC
// and does not need to be provided individually anymore. Therefore, from the protocol perspective,
// the proper data structures are either a block proposal (including the proposer's signature) or
// a certified block (including a QC for the block).
