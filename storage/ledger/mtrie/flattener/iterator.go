// NodeIterator is an iterator over the nodes in a trie.
// It guarantees a DESCENDANTS-FIRST-RELATIONSHIP in the sequence of nodes it generates:
//   * Consider the sequence of nodes, in the order they are generated by NodeIterator.
//     Let `node[k]` denote the node with index `k` in this sequence.
//   * Descendents-First-Relationship means that for any `node[k]`, all its descendents
//     have indices strictly smaller than k in the iterator's sequence.
// The Descendents-First-Relationship has the following important property:
// When re-building the Trie from the sequence of nodes, one can build the trie on the fly,
// as for each node, the children have been previously encountered.
type NodeIterator struct {
	// NodeIterator internal implementation
	// NodeIterator is initialized with an empty stack and the trie's root node assigned to
	// unprocessedRoot. On the FIRST call of Next(), the NodeIterator will traverse the trie
	// starting from the root in a depth-first search (DFS) order (prioritizing the left child
	// over the right, when descending). It pushed the nodes it encounters on the stack,
	// until it hits a leaf node (which then forms the head of the stack).
	// On each subsequent call of Next(), the NodeIterator always pops the head of the stack.
	// Let `n` be the node which was popped from the stack.
	// If the `n` has a parent, denominated as `p`, the parent is now the head of the stack.
	// Parent `p` can either have one or two children.
	//   * If the parent `p` has only one child, there is no other child of `p` to enumerate.
	//   * If the parent has two children:
	//       - if `n` is the left child, we haven't searched through `p.RightChild()`
	//         (as priority is given to the left child)
	//         => we search p.RightChild() and push nodes in DFS manner on the stack
	//            until we hit the first leaf node again
	// By induction, it follows that the head of the stack always contains a node,
	// whose descendents have already been recalled:
	//   * after the initial call of Next(), the head of the stack is a leaf node, which has
	//	   no children, it can be recalled without restriction.
	//   * When popping node `n` from the stack, its parent `p` (if it exists) is now the
	//     head of the stack.
	//     - If `p` has only one child, this child is must be `n`.
	//       Therefore, by recalling `n`, we have recalled all ancestors of `p`.
	//     - If `n` is the right child, we haven already searched through all of `p`
	//       descendents (as the `p.LeftChild` must have been searched before)
	//       Therefore, by recalling `n`, we have recalled all ancestors of `p`
	// Hence, it follows that the head of the stack always satisfies the
	// Descendents-First-Relationship. As we search the trie in DFS manner, each
	// node of the trie is recalled (once). Hence, the algorithm iterates all
	// nodes of the MTrie while guaranteeing Descendents-First-Relationship.

	// unprocessedRoot contains the trie's root before the first call of Next().
	// Thereafter, it is set to nil (which prevents repeated iteration through the trie).
	// This has the advantage, that we gracefully handle tries whose root node is nil.
