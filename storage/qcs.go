// QuorumCertificates represents storage for Quorum Certificates.
// Quorum Certificates are distributed using blocks, where a block incorporates a QC for its parent.
// When stored, QCs are indexed by the Hash of the block they certify (not the block they are included within).
// In the example below, `QC_1` is indexed by `Block_1.Hash()`
// Block_1 <- Block_2(QC_1)

	// Note: For the same block, different QCs can easily be constructed by selecting different sub-sets of the received votes
	// (provided more than the minimal number of consensus participants voted, which is typically the case). In most cases, it
	// is only important that a block has been certified, but irrelevant who specifically contributed to the QC. Therefore, we
	// only store the first QC.
	//
	// If *any* quorum certificate for QC.BlockID has already been stored, a `storage.ErrAlreadyExists` is returned (typically benign).
