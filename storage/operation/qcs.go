// InsertQuorumCertificate atomically performs the following storage operations for the given QuorumCertificate [QC]:
//  1. Check if a QC certifying the same block is already stored.
//  2. Only if no QC exists for the block, append the storage operations for indexing the QC by the block ID it certifies.
//
// CAUTION:
//   - For the same block, different QCs can easily be constructed by selecting different sub-sets
//     of the received votes. In most cases, it is only important that a block has been certified,
//     but it is irrelevant who specifically contributed to the QC. Therefore, we only store the first QC.
//   - In order to make sure only one QC is stored per block, _all calls_ to
//     `InsertQuorumCertificate` must be synchronized by the higher-logic. Currently, we have the
//     lockctx.Proof to prove the higher logic is holding the [storage.LockInsertBlock] when
//     inserting the QC after checking that no QC is already stored.
//
// Expected error returns:
//   - [storage.ErrAlreadyExists] if any QuorumCertificate certifying the samn block already exists
