// IndexNewBlock will add parent-child index for the new block.
//   - Each block that we ingest has a parent, we use this parent-child relationship to build a reverse index
//     for looking up children blocks for a given block. This is useful for forks recovery
//     where we want to find all the pending children blocks for the lastest finalized block.
//
// When adding parent-child index for a new block, we will update two indexes:
//  1. Per protocol convention, blocks must be ingested in "ancestors-first" order. Hence,
//     if a block is new (needs to be verified, to avoid state corruption in case of repeated
//     calls), its set of persisted children is empty at the time of insertion.
//  2. Since the parent block has this new block as a child, we add to the parent block's children.
//     There are two special cases for (2):
//     - If the parent block is zero (i.e. genesis block), then we don't need to add this index.
//     - If the parent block doesn't exist, then we will index the new block as the only child
//     of the parent anyway. This is useful for bootstrapping nodes with truncated history.
