// DeferredBlockPersistOp is a shorthand notation for an anonymous function that takes the ID of
// a fully constructed block and a `transaction.Tx` as inputs and runs some database operations
// as part of that transaction. It is a "Promise Pattern", essentially saying:
// once we have the completed the block's construction, we persist data structures that are
// referenced by the block or populate database indices. This pattern is necessary, because
// internally to the protocol_state package we don't have access to the candidate block ID yet because
// we are still determining the protocol state ID for that block.

// DeferredBlockPersist is a utility for accumulating deferred database interactions that
// are supposed to be executed in one atomic transaction. It supports:
//   - Deferred database operations that work directly on Badger transactions.
//   - Deferred database operations that work on `transaction.Tx`.
//     Tx is a storage-layer abstraction, with support for callbacks that are executed
//     after the underlying database transaction completed _successfully_.
//   - Deferred database operations that depend on the ID of the block under construction
//     and `transaction.Tx`. Especially useful for populating `ByBlockID` indices.
//
// ORDER OF EXECUTION
// We extend the process in which `transaction.Tx` executes database operations, schedules
// callbacks, and executed the callbacks. Specifically, DeferredDbOps proceeds as follows:
//
//  0. Record functors added via `AddBadgerOp`, `AddDbOp`, `OnSucceed` ...
//     • some functors may schedule callbacks (depending on their type), which are executed
//     after the underlying database transaction completed _successfully_.
//     • `OnSucceed` is treated exactly the same way:
//     it schedules a callback during its execution, but it has no database actions.
//  1. Execute the functors in the order they were added
//  2. During each functor's execution:
//     • some functors may schedule callbacks (depending on their type)
//     • record those callbacks in the order they are scheduled (no execution yet)
//  3. If and only if the underlying database transaction succeeds, run the callbacks
//
// DESIGN PATTERN
//   - DeferredDbOps is stateful, i.e. it needs to be passed as pointer variable.
//   - Do not instantiate Tx directly. Instead, use one of the following
//     transaction.Update(db, DeferredDbOps.Pending().WithBlock(blockID))
//     transaction.View(db, DeferredDbOps.Pending().WithBlock(blockID))
//     operation.RetryOnConflictTx(db, transaction.Update, DeferredDbOps.Pending().WithBlock(blockID))
//
// NOT CONCURRENCY SAFE
