// InsertQuorumCertificate upserts a quorum certificate by block ID.

// collision-resistant hash function. For the same block, different QCs can easily be constructed by selecting
// different sub-sets of the received votes (provided more than the minimal number of consensus participants voted,
// which is typically the case). In most cases, it is only important that a block has been certified, but it is
// irrelevant who specifically contributed to the QC. Therefore, we only store the first QC.
//
// If *any* quorum certificate for the block already exists, it returns storage.ErrAlreadyExists (typically benign).
