// makeLockPolicy constructs the policy used by the storage layer to prevent deadlocks.
// We use a policy defined by a directed acyclic graph, where nodes are named locks.
// A directed edge between two nodes A, B means: I can acquire B next after acquiring A.
// When no edges are added, each lock context may acquire at most one lock.
//
// For example, the bootstrapping logic both inserts and finalizes block. So it needs to
// acquire both LockInsertBlock and LockFinalizeBlock. To allow this, we add the directed
// edge LockInsertBlock -> LockFinalizeBlock with `Add(LockInsertBlock, LockFinalizeBlock)`.
// This means:
//   - a context can acquire either LockInsertBlock or LockFinalizeBlock first (always true)
//   - a context holding LockInsertBlock can acquire LockFinalizeBlock next (allowed by the edge)
//   - a context holding LockFinalizeBlock cannot acquire LockInsertBlock next (disallowed, because the edge is directed)
