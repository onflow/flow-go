// MakeSingletonLockManager returns the lock manager used by the storage layer.
// This function must be used for production builds and must be called exactly once process-wide.
//
// The Lock Manager is a core component enforcing atomicity of various storage operations across different
// components. Therefore, the lock manager is a singleton instance, as the storage layer's atomicity and
// consistency depends on the same set of locks being used everywhere.
// By convention, the lock manager singleton is injected into the node's components during their
// initialization, following the same dependency-injection pattern as other components that are conceptually
// singletons (e.g. the storage layer abstractions). Thereby, we explicitly codify in the constructor that a
// component uses the lock manager. We think it is helpful to emphasize that the component at times
// will acquire _exclusive access_ to all key-value pairs in the database whose keys start with some specific
// prefixes (see `storage/badger/operation/prefix.go` for an exhaustive list of prefixes).
// In comparison, the alternative pattern (which we do not use) of retrieving a singleton instance via a
// global variable would hide which components required exclusive storage access, and in addition, it would
// break with our broadly established dependency-injection pattern. To enforce best practices, this function
// will panic if it is called more than once.
//
// CAUTION:
//   - The lock manager only guarantees atomicity of reads and writes for the thread holding the lock.
//     Other threads can continue to read (possibly stale) values, while the lock is held by a different thread.
//   - Furthermore, the writer must bundle all their writes into a _single_ Write Batch for atomicity. Even
//     when holding the lock, reading threads can still observe the writes of one batch while not observing
//     the writes of a second batch, despite the thread writing both batches while holding the lock. It was
//     a deliberate choice for the sake of performance to allow reads without any locking - so instead of
//     waiting for the newest value in case a write is currently ongoing, the reader will just retrieve the
//     previous value. This aligns with our architecture of the node operating as an eventually-consistent
//     system, which favors loose coupling and high throughput for different components within a node.
