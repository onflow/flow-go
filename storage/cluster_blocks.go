// by *one specific* collector cluster (identified by the ClusterChainID).
// For consistency, method naming is analogous to the [storage.Blocks] interface. Though,
// at the moment, we only need to store [cluster.Proposal]. Therefore, methods `ByID` and
// `ByHeight` don't exist here (but might be added later).
