	// nodes by default will be withdrawn, and the peer will be slightly penalized. In other words, under-performing in a topic mesh
	// will drop the overall score of a peer by 5% of the MaxAppSpecificReward that is awarded by our app-specific scoring function.
	// It means that under-performing in a topic mesh will not cause a peer to be disconnected, but it will cause the peer to lose
	// its MaxAppSpecificReward that is awarded by our app-specific scoring function.
	// At this point, we do not want to disconnect a peer only because it is under-performing in a topic mesh as it might be
	// causing a false positive network partition.

	// We set it to the decay interval of the GossipSub scoring system, which is 1 minute.
	// It means that if a peer delivers a message that it has already seen less than one minute ago,
	// the delivery will be counted towards the score of the peer in a topic mesh only if the previous sender of the message.
	// This also prevents replay attacks of messages that are older than one minute. As replayed messages will not
	// be counted towards the actual message deliveries of a peer in a topic mesh.

	// the number of actual message deliveries of a peer in a topic mesh.
	// With a default decay interval of 1 minute, it means that we wait for 2 minutes before start counting the
	// number of actual message deliveries of a peer in a topic mesh. This is to account for

	// defaultBehaviorPenaltyThreshold is the threshold when the behavior of a peer is considered as bad by GossipSub.

	// for a while, and the remote peer keep attempting on GRAFT (aka GRAFT flood).
	// When the misbehavior counter of a peer goes beyond this threshold, the peer is penalized by defaultBehaviorPenaltyWeight (see below) for the excess misbehavior.
	//
	// An iHave broken promise means that a peer advertises an iHave for a message, but does not respond to the iWant requests for that message.
	// For iHave broken promises, the gossipsub scoring works as follows:
	// It samples ONLY A SINGLE iHave out of the entire RPC.
	// If that iHave is not followed by an actual message within the next 3 seconds, the peer misbehavior counter is incremented by 1.
	//
	// We set it to 10, meaning that we at most tolerate 10 of such RPCs containing iHave broken promises. After that, the peer is penalized for every
	// excess RPC containing iHave broken promises.
	// The counter is also decayed by (0.99) every decay interval (defaultDecayInterval) i.e., every minute.
	// Note that misbehaviors are counted by GossipSub across all topics (and is different from the Application Layer Misbehaviors that we count through
	// the ALSP system).

	// defaultBehaviorPenaltyWeight is the weight for applying penalty when a peer misbehavior goes beyond the threshold.
	// Misbehavior of a peer at gossipsub layer is defined as advertising an iHave without responding to the iWants (broken promises), as well as attempting
	// on GRAFT when the peer is considered for a PRUNE backoff, i.e., the local peer does not allow the peer to join the local topic mesh
	// This is detected by the GossipSub scoring system, and the peer is penalized by defaultBehaviorPenaltyWeight.
	//
	// An iHave broken promise means that a peer advertises an iHave for a message, but does not respond to the iWant requests for that message.
	// For iHave broken promises, the gossipsub scoring works as follows:
	// It samples ONLY A SINGLE iHave out of the entire RPC.
	// If that iHave is not followed by an actual message within the next 3 seconds, the peer misbehavior counter is incremented by 1.
	//
	// The penalty is applied to the square of the difference between the misbehavior counter and the threshold, i.e., -|w| * (misbehavior counter - threshold)^2.
	// We set it to 0.01 * MaxAppSpecificPenalty, which means that misbehaving 10 times more than the threshold (i.e., 10 + 10) will cause the peer to lose
	// its entire AppSpecificReward that is awarded by our app-specific scoring function to all staked (i.e., authorized) nodes by default.
	// Moreover, as the MaxAppSpecificPenalty is -MaxAppSpecificReward, misbehaving sqrt(2) * 10 times more than the threshold will cause the peer score
	// to be dropped below the MaxAppSpecificPenalty, which is also below the GraylistThreshold, and the peer will be graylisted (i.e., disconnected).
	//
	// The math is as follows: -|w| * (misbehavior - threshold)^2 = 0.01 * MaxAppSpecificPenalty * (misbehavior - threshold)^2 < 2 * MaxAppSpecificPenalty
	// if misbehavior > threshold + sqrt(2) * 10.
	// As shown above, with this choice of defaultBehaviorPenaltyWeight, misbehaving sqrt(2) * 10 times more than the threshold will cause the peer score
	// to be dropped below the MaxAppSpecificPenalty, which is also below the GraylistThreshold, and the peer will be graylisted (i.e., disconnected). This weight
	// is chosen in a way that with almost a few misbehaviors more than the threshold, the peer will be graylisted. The rationale relies on the fact that
	// the misbehavior counter is incremented by 1 for each RPC containing one or more broken promises. Hence, it is per RPC, and not per broken promise.
	// Having sqrt(2) * 10 broken promises RPC is a blatant misbehavior, and the peer should be graylisted. With decay interval of 1 minute, and decay value of
	// 0.99 we expect a graylisted node due to borken promises to get back in about 527 minutes, i.e., (0.99)^x * (sqrt(2) * 10)^2 * MaxAppSpecificPenalty > GraylistThreshold
	// where x is the number of decay intervals that the peer is graylisted. As MaxAppSpecificPenalty and GraylistThresholds are close, we can simplify the inequality
	// to (0.99)^x * (sqrt(2) * 10)^2 > 1 --> (0.99)^x * 200 > 1 --> (0.99)^x > 1/200 --> x > log(1/200) / log(0.99) --> x > 527.17 decay intervals, i.e., 527 minutes.
	// Note that misbehaviors are counted by GossipSub across all topics (and is different from the Application Layer Misbehaviors that we count through
	// the ALSP system that are reported by the engines).

	//
	// An iHave broken promise means that a peer advertises an iHave for a message, but does not respond to the iWant requests for that message.
	// For iHave broken promises, the gossipsub scoring works as follows:
	// It samples ONLY A SINGLE iHave out of the entire RPC.
	// If that iHave is not followed by an actual message within the next 3 seconds, the peer misbehavior counter is incremented by 1.
	// This means that regardless of how many iHave broken promises an RPC contains, the misbehavior counter is incremented by 1.
	// That is why we decay the misbehavior counter very slow, as this counter indicates a severe misbehavior.
	//
	// The misbehavior counter is decayed per decay interval (i.e., defaultDecayInterval = 1 minute) by GossipSub.
	// We set it to 0.99, which means that the misbehavior counter is decayed by 1% per decay interval.
	// With the generous threshold that we set (i.e., defaultBehaviourPenaltyThreshold = 10), we take the peers going beyond the threshold as persistent misbehaviors,
