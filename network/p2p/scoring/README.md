# GossipSub App Specific Score 

This package provides a scoring mechanism for peers in a GossipSub network by computing their application-specific scores.
Application-specific score is part of the GossipSub scoring mechanism, which is used to determine the behavior of peers in the network from
the perspective of their behavior at the application level (i.e., Flow protocol).
The score is determined based on a combination of penalties and rewards related to various factors, such as spamming misbehaviors, staking status, and valid subscriptions.

## Key Components
1. `GossipSubAppSpecificScoreRegistry`: This struct maintains the necessary information for determining a peer's score.
2. `AppSpecificScoreFunc`: This function is exposed to GossipSub and calculates the application-specific score for a peer based on penalties and rewards.
3. `stakingScore`: This function computes the staking score (reward/penalty) for a peer based on their identity and role.
4. `subscriptionPenalty`: This function calculates the penalty for invalid subscriptions.
5. `OnInvalidControlMessageNotification`: This method updates a peer's penalty when an invalid control message misbehavior is detected, e.g., spamming on a control message.

## Score Calculation
The application-specific score for a peer is calculated as the sum of the following factors:

1. Spam Penalty: A penalty applied when a peer conducts a spamming misbehavior (e.g., GRAFT, PRUNE, iHave, or iWant misbehaviors).
2. Staking Penalty: A penalty applied for unknown peers with invalid Flow protocol identities. This ejects them from the GossipSub network. 
3. Subscription Penalty: A penalty applied when a peer subscribes to a topic they are not allowed to, based on their role in the Flow network.
4. Staking Reward: A reward applied to well-behaved staked peers (excluding access nodes at the moment) only if they have no penalties from spamming or invalid subscriptions.

The score is updated every time a peer misbehaves, and the spam penalties decay over time using the default decay function, which applies a geometric decay to the peer's score.

### Usage
To use the scoring mechanism, create a new `GossipSubAppSpecificScoreRegistry` with the desired configuration, and then obtain the `AppSpecificScoreFunc` to be passed to the GossipSub protocol.

Example:
```go
config := &GossipSubAppSpecificScoreRegistryConfig{
	// ... configure the required components
}
registry := NewGossipSubAppSpecificScoreRegistry(config)
appSpecificScoreFunc := registry.AppSpecificScoreFunc()

// Use appSpecificScoreFunc as the score function for GossipSub
```

The scoring mechanism can be easily integrated with the GossipSub protocol to ensure that well-behaved peers are prioritized, and misbehaving peers are penalized. See the `ScoreOption` below for more details.

**Note**: This package was designed specifically for the Flow network and might require adjustments if used in other contexts.


## Score Option
`ScoreOption` is a configuration object for the peer scoring system in the Flow network.
It defines several scoring parameters and thresholds that determine the behavior of the network towards its peers.
This includes rewarding well-behaving peers and penalizing misbehaving ones.

**Note**: `ScoreOption` is passed to the GossipSub as a configuration option at the time of initialization.

### Usage
To use the `ScoreOption`, you need to create a `ScoreOptionConfig` with the desired settings and then call `NewScoreOption` with that configuration.

```go
config := NewScoreOptionConfig(logger)
config.SetProvider(identityProvider)
config.SetCacheSize(1000)
config.SetCacheMetrics(metricsCollector)

// Optional: Set custom app-specific scoring function
config.SetAppSpecificScoreFunction(customAppSpecificScoreFunction)

scoreOption := NewScoreOption(config)
```

### Scoring Parameters
`ScoreOption` provides a set of default scoring parameters and thresholds that can be configured through the `ScoreOptionConfig`. These parameters include:

1. `AppSpecificScoreWeight`: The weight of the application-specific score in the overall peer score calculation at the GossipSub.
2. `GossipThreshold`: The threshold below which a peer's score will result in ignoring gossips to and from that peer.
3. `PublishThreshold`: The threshold below which a peer's score will result in not propagating self-published messages to that peer.
4. `GraylistThreshold`: The threshold below which a peer's score will result in ignoring incoming RPCs from that peer.
5. `AcceptPXThreshold`: The threshold above which a peer's score will result in accepting PX information with a prune from that peer. PX stands for "Peer Exchange" in the context of libp2p's gossipsub protocol. When a peer sends a PRUNE control message to another peer, it can include a list of other peers as PX information. The purpose of this is to help the pruned peer find new peers to replace the ones that have been pruned from its mesh. When a node receives a PRUNE message containing PX information, it can decide whether to connect to the suggested peers based on its own criteria. In this package, the `DefaultAcceptPXThreshold` is used to determine if the originating peer's penalty score is good enough to accept the PX information. If the originating peer's penalty score exceeds the threshold, the node will consider connecting to the suggested peers.
6. `OpportunisticGraftThreshold`: The threshold below which the median peer score in the mesh may result in selecting more peers with a higher score for opportunistic grafting.

### Flow Specific Scoring Parameters and Thresholds
# GossipSub Scoring Parameters Explained
1. `DefaultAppSpecificScoreWeight = 1`: This is the default weight for application-specific scoring. It basically tells us how important the application-specific score is in comparison to other scores.
2. `MaxAppSpecificPenalty = -100` and `MinAppSpecificPenalty = -1`: These values define the range for application-specific penalties. A peer can have a maximum penalty of -100 and a minimum penalty of -1.
3. `MaxAppSpecificReward = 100`: This is the maximum reward a peer can earn for good behavior.
4. `DefaultStakedIdentityReward = MaxAppSpecificReward`: This reward is given to peers that contribute positively to the network (i.e., no misbehavior). Itâ€™s to encourage them and prioritize them in neighbor selection.
5. `DefaultUnknownIdentityPenalty = MaxAppSpecificPenalty`: This penalty is given to a peer if it's not in the identity list. It's to discourage anonymity.
6. `DefaultInvalidSubscriptionPenalty = MaxAppSpecificPenalty`: This penalty is for peers that subscribe to topics they are not authorized to subscribe to.
7. `DefaultGossipThreshold = -99`: If a peer's penalty goes below this threshold, the peer is ignored for gossip. It means no gossip is sent to or received from that peer.
8. `DefaultPublishThreshold = -99`: If a peer's penalty goes below this threshold, self-published messages will not be sent to this peer.
9. `DefaultGraylistThreshold = -99`: If a peer's penalty goes below this threshold, it is graylisted. This means all incoming messages from this peer are ignored.
10. `DefaultAcceptPXThreshold = 99`: This is a threshold for accepting peers. If a peer sends information and its score is above this threshold, the information is accepted.
11. `DefaultOpportunisticGraftThreshold = MaxAppSpecificReward + 1`: This value is used to selectively connect to new peers if the median score of the current peers drops below this threshold.
12. `defaultScoreCacheSize = 1000`: Sets the default size of the cache used to store the application-specific penalty of peers.
13. `defaultDecayInterval = 1 * time.Minute`: Sets the default interval at which the score of a peer will be decayed.
14. `defaultDecayToZero = 0.01`: This is a threshold below which a decayed score is reset to zero. It prevents the score from decaying to a very small value.
15. `defaultTopicTimeInMeshQuantum` is a parameter in the GossipSub scoring system that represents a fixed time interval used to count the amount of time a peer stays in a topic mesh. It is set to 1 hour, meaning that for each hour a peer remains in a topic mesh, its time-in-mesh counter increases by 1, contributing to its availability score. This is to reward peers that stay in the mesh for longer durations and discourage those that frequently join and leave.
16. `defaultTopicInvalidMessageDeliveriesWeight` is set to -1.0 and is used to penalize peers that send invalid messages by applying it to the square of the number of such messages. A message is considered invalid if it is not properly signed. A peer will be disconnected if it sends around 14 invalid messages within a gossipsub heartbeat interval.
17. `defaultTopicInvalidMessageDeliveriesDecay` is a decay factor set to 0.99. It is used to reduce the number of invalid message deliveries counted against a peer by 1% at each heartbeat interval. This prevents the peer from being disconnected if it stops sending invalid messages. The heartbeat interval in the gossipsub scoring system is set to 1 minute by default.

## Customization
The scoring mechanism can be easily customized to suit the needs of the Flow network. This includes changing the scoring parameters, thresholds, and the scoring function itself.
You can customize the scoring parameters and thresholds by using the various setter methods provided in the `ScoreOptionConfig` object. Additionally, you can provide a custom app-specific scoring function through the `SetAppSpecificScoreFunction` method.

**Note**: Usage of non-default app-specific scoring function is not recommended unless you are familiar with the scoring mechanism and the Flow network. It may result in _routing attack vulnerabilities_. It is **always safer** to use the default scoring function unless you know what you are doing.

Example of setting custom app-specific scoring function:
```go
config.SetAppSpecificScoreFunction(customAppSpecificScoreFunction)
```


## Peer Scoring System Integration
The peer scoring system is integrated with the GossipSub protocol through the `ScoreOption` configuration option. 
This option is passed to the GossipSub at the time of initialization.
`ScoreOption` can be used to build scoring options for GossipSub protocol with the desired scoring parameters and thresholds.
```go
flowPubSubOption := scoreOption.BuildFlowPubSubScoreOption()
gossipSubOption := scoreOption.BuildGossipSubScoreOption()
```
