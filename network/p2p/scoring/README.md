# GossipSub App Specific Score 

This package provides a scoring mechanism for peers in a GossipSub network by computing their application-specific scores.
Application-specific score is part of the GossipSub scoring mechanism, which is used to determine the behavior of peers in the network from
the perspective of their behavior at the application level (i.e., Flow protocol).
The score is determined based on a combination of penalties and rewards related to various factors, such as spamming misbehaviors, staking status, and valid subscriptions.

## Key Components
1. `GossipSubAppSpecificScoreRegistry`: This struct maintains the necessary information for determining a peer's score.
2. `AppSpecificScoreFunc`: This function is exposed to GossipSub and calculates the application-specific score for a peer based on penalties and rewards.
3. `stakingScore`: This function computes the staking score (reward/penalty) for a peer based on their identity and role.
4. `subscriptionPenalty`: This function calculates the penalty for invalid subscriptions.
5. `OnInvalidControlMessageNotification`: This method updates a peer's penalty when an invalid control message misbehavior is detected, e.g., spamming on a control message.

## Score Calculation
The application-specific score for a peer is calculated as the sum of the following factors:

1. Spam Penalty: A penalty applied when a peer conducts a spamming misbehavior (e.g., GRAFT, PRUNE, iHave, or iWant misbehaviors).
2. Staking Penalty: A penalty applied for unknown peers with invalid Flow protocol identities. This ejects them from the GossipSub network. 
3. Subscription Penalty: A penalty applied when a peer subscribes to a topic they are not allowed to, based on their role in the Flow network.
4. Staking Reward: A reward applied to well-behaved staked peers (excluding access nodes at the moment) only if they have no penalties from spamming or invalid subscriptions.

The score is updated every time a peer misbehaves, and the spam penalties decay over time using the default decay function, which applies a geometric decay to the peer's score.

### Usage
To use the scoring mechanism, create a new `GossipSubAppSpecificScoreRegistry` with the desired configuration, and then obtain the `AppSpecificScoreFunc` to be passed to the GossipSub protocol.

Example:
```go
config := &GossipSubAppSpecificScoreRegistryConfig{
	// ... configure the required components
}
registry := NewGossipSubAppSpecificScoreRegistry(config)
appSpecificScoreFunc := registry.AppSpecificScoreFunc()

// Use appSpecificScoreFunc as the score function for GossipSub
```

The scoring mechanism can be easily integrated with the GossipSub protocol to ensure that well-behaved peers are prioritized, and misbehaving peers are penalized. See the `ScoreOption` below for more details.

**Note**: This package was designed specifically for the Flow network and might require adjustments if used in other contexts.


## Score Option
`ScoreOption` is a configuration object for the peer scoring system in the Flow network.
It defines several scoring parameters and thresholds that determine the behavior of the network towards its peers.
This includes rewarding well-behaving peers and penalizing misbehaving ones.

**Note**: `ScoreOption` is passed to the GossipSub as a configuration option at the time of initialization.

### Usage
To use the `ScoreOption`, you need to create a `ScoreOptionConfig` with the desired settings and then call `NewScoreOption` with that configuration.

```go
config := NewScoreOptionConfig(logger)
config.SetProvider(identityProvider)
config.SetCacheSize(1000)
config.SetCacheMetrics(metricsCollector)

// Optional: Set custom app-specific scoring function
config.SetAppSpecificScoreFunction(customAppSpecificScoreFunction)

scoreOption := NewScoreOption(config)
```

### Scoring Parameters
`ScoreOption` provides a set of default scoring parameters and thresholds that can be configured through the `ScoreOptionConfig`. These parameters include:

1. `AppSpecificScoreWeight`: The weight of the application-specific score in the overall peer score calculation at the GossipSub.
2. `GossipThreshold`: The threshold below which a peer's score will result in ignoring gossips to and from that peer.
3. `PublishThreshold`: The threshold below which a peer's score will result in not propagating self-published messages to that peer.
4. `GraylistThreshold`: The threshold below which a peer's score will result in ignoring incoming RPCs from that peer.
5. `AcceptPXThreshold`: The threshold above which a peer's score will result in accepting PX information with a prune from that peer. PX stands for "Peer Exchange" in the context of libp2p's gossipsub protocol. When a peer sends a PRUNE control message to another peer, it can include a list of other peers as PX information. The purpose of this is to help the pruned peer find new peers to replace the ones that have been pruned from its mesh. When a node receives a PRUNE message containing PX information, it can decide whether to connect to the suggested peers based on its own criteria. In this package, the `DefaultAcceptPXThreshold` is used to determine if the originating peer's penalty score is good enough to accept the PX information. If the originating peer's penalty score exceeds the threshold, the node will consider connecting to the suggested peers.
6. `OpportunisticGraftThreshold`: The threshold below which the median peer score in the mesh may result in selecting more peers with a higher score for opportunistic grafting.

## Customization
The scoring mechanism can be easily customized to suit the needs of the Flow network. This includes changing the scoring parameters, thresholds, and the scoring function itself.
You can customize the scoring parameters and thresholds by using the various setter methods provided in the `ScoreOptionConfig` object. Additionally, you can provide a custom app-specific scoring function through the `SetAppSpecificScoreFunction` method.

**Note**: Usage of non-default app-specific scoring function is not recommended unless you are familiar with the scoring mechanism and the Flow network. It may result in _routing attack vulnerabilities_. It is **always safer** to use the default scoring function unless you know what you are doing.

Example of setting custom app-specific scoring function:
```go
config.SetAppSpecificScoreFunction(customAppSpecificScoreFunction)
```


## Peer Scoring System Integration
The peer scoring system is integrated with the GossipSub protocol through the `ScoreOption` configuration option. 
This option is passed to the GossipSub at the time of initialization.
`ScoreOption` can be used to build scoring options for GossipSub protocol with the desired scoring parameters and thresholds.
```go
flowPubSubOption := scoreOption.BuildFlowPubSubScoreOption()
gossipSubOption := scoreOption.BuildGossipSubScoreOption()
```
