// SealingAndVerificationHappyPathTest evaluates the health of the happy path of verification and sealing. It
// deploys a transaction into the testnet hence causing an execution result with more than
// one chunk, assigns all chunks to the same single verification node in this testnet, and then verifies whether verification node
// generates a result approval for all chunks of that execution result.
// It also enables sealing based on result approvals and verifies whether the block of that specific multi-chunk execution result is sealed
// affected by the emitted result approvals.
//
// It returns the execution receipts and result approvals that are involved in this test.
