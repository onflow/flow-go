// it for the contributors for the root QC). For mainnet, this a *strict subset* of all consensus participants:
//   - In an early step during the bootstrapping process, every node operator locally generates votes for the root block from the nodes they
//     operate. During the vote-generation step, (see function `constructRootVotes`), `Participants` represents only the operator's own
//     nodes (generally a small minority of the entire consensus committee).
//   - During a subsequent step of the bootstrapping process, the Flow Foundation collects a supermajority of votes from the consensus
//     participants and constructs the root QC  (see function `constructRootQC`). Here, `Participants` is only populated with
//     the information of the internal nodes that the Flow Foundation runs, but not used.
//
// Furthermore, ParticipantData contains auxiliary data about the DKG to set up the random beacon. Note that the consensus committee ùíû and the
// DKG committee ùíü are generally _not_ identical. We explicitly want to support that _either_ set can have nodes that are not in
// the other set (formally ùíü \ ùíû ‚â† ‚àÖ and ùíû \ ùíü ‚â† ‚àÖ). ParticipantData has no direct representation of the consensus committee ùíû.

//     i := DKGIndexMap[d] denotes the index, by which the low-level cryptographic DKG protocol references
//     the participant. For details, please see the documentation of [flow.DKGIndexMap].
//   - keyShares: holds the public key share for every member of the DKG committee ùíü (irrespective
//     of successful participation). For a member of the DKG committee with nodeID `d`, the respective
//     public key share is keyShares[DKGIndexMap[d]].
