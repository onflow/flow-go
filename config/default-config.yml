  # Connection manager config
  # HighWatermark and LowWatermark govern the number of connections are maintained by the ConnManager.
  # When the peer count exceeds the HighWatermark, as many peers will be pruned (and
  # their connections terminated) until LowWatermark peers remain. In other words, whenever the
  # peer count is x > HighWatermark, the ConnManager will prune x - LowWatermark peers.
  # The pruning algorithm is as follows:
  # 1. The ConnManager will not prune any peers that have been connected for less than GracePeriod.
  # 2. The ConnManager will not prune any peers that are protected.
  # 3. The ConnManager will sort the peers based on their number of streams and direction of connections, and
  # prunes the peers with the least number of streams. If there are ties, the peer with the incoming connection
  # will be pruned. If both peers have incoming connections, and there are still ties, one of the peers will be
  # pruned at random.
  # Algorithm implementation is in https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/master/p2p/net/connmgr/connmgr.go#L262-L318
