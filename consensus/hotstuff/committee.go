// A committee provides a subset of the protocol.State, which is restricted to exactly those
// nodes that participate in the current HotStuff instance: the state of all legitimate HotStuff
// participants for the specified view. Legitimate HotStuff participants have NON-ZERO WEIGHT.
//
// For the purposes of validating votes, timeouts, quorum certificates, and timeout certificates
// we consider a committee which is static over the course of an epoch. Although committee
// members may be ejected, or have their weight change during an epoch, we ignore these changes.
// For these purposes we use the Replicas and *ByEpoch methods.
//
// When validating proposals, we take into account changes to the committee during the course of
// an epoch. In particular, if a node is ejected, we will immediately reject all future proposals
// from that node. For these purposes we use the DynamicCommittee and *ByBlock methods.

// Replicas defines the consensus committee for the purposes of validating votes, timeouts,
// quorum certificates, and timeout certificates. Any consensus committee member who was
// authorized to contribute to consensus AT THE BEGINNING of the epoch may produce valid
// votes and timeouts for the entire epoch, even if they are later ejected.
// So for validating votes/timeouts we use *ByEpoch methods.
//
// Since the voter committee is considered static over an epoch:
// * we can query identities by view
// * we don't need the full block ancestry prior to validating messages

	//          Therefore, a node retains its proposer view slots even if it is slashed.
	//          Its proposal is simply considered invalid, as it is not from a legitimate participant.

	// QuorumThresholdForView returns the minimum total weight for a supermajority
	// at the given view. This weight threshold is computed using the total weight
	// of the initial committee and is static over the course of an epoch.

	//   * model.ErrViewForUnknownEpoch if no epoch containing the given view is known

	// TimeoutThresholdForView returns the minimum total weight of observed timeout objects
