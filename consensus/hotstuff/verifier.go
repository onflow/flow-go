// Verifier is the component responsible for the cryptographic integrity of
// votes, proposals and QC's against the block they are signing.
// Overall, there are two criteria for the validity of a vote and QC:
//  (1) the signer ID(s) must correspond to authorized consensus participants
//  (2) the signature must be cryptographically valid.
// Note that Verifier only implements (2). This API design allows to decouple
//  (i) the common logic for checking that a super-majority of the consensus
//      committee voted
// (ii) the handling of combined staking+RandomBeacon votes (consensus nodes)
//      vs only staking votes (collector nodes)
// On the one hand, this API design makes code less concise, as the two checks
// are now distributed over API boundaries. On the other hand, we can avoid
// repeated Identity lookups in the implementation, which increases performance.

	//  * nil if `sigData` is cryptographically valid
	//  * model.ErrInvalidFormat if the signature has an incompatible format.
	//  * model.ErrInvalidSignature is the signature is invalid
	//  * model.InvalidSignerError is only relevant for extended signature schemes,

	//    participants (e.g. random beacon). In case a participant signed despite not
	//    being authorized, an InvalidSignerError is returned.

	//    edge cases in the logic (i.e. as fatal)
