	//  -  (collector, true, nil) if no collector can be found by the block ID, and a new collector was created.
	//  -  (collector, false, nil) if the collector can be found by the block ID
	//  -  (nil, false, error) if running into any exception creating the vote collector state machine

	// an invalid view. In that case, would we create a vote collector?
