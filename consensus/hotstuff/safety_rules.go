	//  * (nil, model.NoTimeoutError): If replica is not part of the authorized consensus committee (anymore) and
	//    therefore is not authorized to produce a valid timeout object. This sentinel error is _expected_ during
	//    normal operation, e.g. during the grace-period after Epoch switchover or after the replica self-ejected.
