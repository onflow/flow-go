// TimerInfo represents a local timeout for a view, and indicates the Pacemaker has not yet
// observed evidence to transition to the next view (QC or TC). When a timeout occurs for
// the first time in a view, we will broadcast a TimeoutObject and continue waiting for evidence
// to enter the next view, but we will no longer submit a vote for this view. A timeout may occur
// multiple times for the same round, which is an indication
// to re-broadcast our TimeoutObject for the view, to ensure liveness.

	// view will have the same Duration).

// NewViewEvent indicates that a new view has started. While it has the same
// data model as `TimerInfo`, their semantics are different (hence we use
// different types): `TimerInfo` represents a continuous time interval. In
// contrast, NewViewEvent marks the specific point in time, when the timer
// is started.

// HotStuff vote. Valid TimeoutObject is signed by staking key.

	// timeout for this view. When the timer for the view's original duration expires, a `TimeoutObject`
	// with `TimeoutTick = 0` is broadcast. Subsequently, `timeout.Controller` re-broadcasts the
	// `TimeoutObject` periodically  based on some internal heuristic. Each time we attempt a re-broadcast,
	// the `TimeoutTick` is incremented. Incrementing the field prevents de-duplicated within the network layer,
	// which in turn guarantees quick delivery of the `TimeoutObject` after GST and facilitates recovery.
	// This field is not part of timeout object ID. Thereby, two timeouts are identical if only they differ
	// by their TimeoutTick value.
