// safetyRulesConcurrencyWrapper wraps `hotstuff.SafetyRules` to allow its usage in concurrent environments.
// Correctness requirements:
//
//	 (i) The wrapper's Sign function is called exactly once (wrapper errors on repeated Sign calls)
//	(ii) SafetyRules is not accessed outside the wrapper concurrently. The wrapper cannot enforce this.
//
// The correctness condition (ii) holds because there is a single dedicated thread executing the Event Loop,
// including the EventHandler, that also runs the logic of `BlockProducer.MakeBlockProposal`.
//
// Concurrency safety:
//
//	(a) There is one dedicated thread executing the Event Loop, including the EventHandler, that also runs the logic of
//	    `BlockProducer.MakeBlockProposal`. Hence, while the 'Event Loop Thread' is in `MakeBlockProposal`, we are guaranteed
//	    the only interactions with `SafetyRules` are in `module.Builder.BuildOn`
//	(b) The Event Loop Thread instantiates the variable `signingStatus`. Furthermore, the `signer` call first reads `signingStatus`.
//	    Therefore, all operations in the EventHandler prior to calling `Builder.BuildOn(..)` happen before the call to `signer`.
//	    Hence, it is guaranteed that the `signer` uses the most recent state of `SafetyRules`, even if `Sign` is executed by a
//	    different thread.
//	(c) Just before the `signer` call returns, it writes `signingStatus`. Furthermore, the Event Loop Thread reads `signingStatus`
//	    right after the `Builder.BuildOn(..)` call returns. Thereby, Event Loop Thread sees the most recent state of `SafetyRules`
//	    after completing the signing operation.
//
// With the transitivity of the 'Happens Before' relationship (-> go Memory Model https://go.dev/ref/mem#atomic), we have proven
// that concurrent access of the wrapped `safetyRules` is safe for the state transition:
//
//	instantiate signingStatus to 0  ─►  update signingStatus from 0 to 1 → signer → update signingStatus from 1 to 2  ─►  confirm signingStatus has value 2

//
// All state transitions _other_ than the one above yield exceptions without modifying `SafetyRules`.
