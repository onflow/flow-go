// EventHandler is the main handler for individual events that trigger state transition.
// It exposes API to handle one event at a time synchronously. EventHandler is *not concurrency safe*.
// Please use the EventLoop to ensure that only a single go-routine executes the EventHandler's algorithms.
// EventHandler is implemented in event-driven way, it reacts to incoming events and performs certain actions.
// It doesn't perform any actions on its own. There are 3 main responsibilities of EventHandler, vote, propose,
// timeout. There are specific scenarios that lead to each of those actions.
//   - create vote: voting logic is triggered by OnReceiveProposal, after receiving proposal we have all required information
//     to create a valid vote. Compliance engine makes sure that we receive proposals, whose parents are known.
//     Creating a vote can be triggered ONLY by receiving proposal.
//   - create timeout: creating model.TimeoutObject[TO] is triggered by OnLocalTimeout, after reaching deadline for current round.
//     EventHandler gets notified about it and has to create a model.TimeoutObject and broadcast it to other replicas.
//     Creating a TO can be triggered by reaching round deadline or triggered as part of Bracha broadcast when superminority
//     of replicas have contributed to TC creation and created a partial TC.
//   - create a proposal: proposing logic is more complicated. Creating a proposal is triggered by the EventHandler receiving
//     a QC or TC that induces a view change to a view where the replica is primary. As an edge case, the EventHandler
//     can receive a QC or TC that triggers the view change, but we can't create a proposal in case we are missing parent block the newest QC refers to.
//     In case we already have the QC, but are still missing the respective parent, OnReceiveProposal can trigger the proposing logic
//     as well, but only when receiving proposal for view lower than active view.
//     To summarize, to make a valid proposal for view N we need to have a QC or TC for N-1 and know the proposal with blockID
//     NewestQC.BlockID.
//
// Not concurrency safe.
