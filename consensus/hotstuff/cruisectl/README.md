# Cruise Control: Automated Block Time Adjustment for Precise Epoch Switchover Timing

# Overview

## Context

Epochs have a fixed length, measured in views.
The actual view rate of the network varies depending on network conditions, e.g. load, number of offline replicas, etc.
We would like for consensus nodes to observe the actual view rate of the committee, and adjust how quickly they proceed
through views accordingly, to target a desired weekly epoch switchover time.

## High-Level Design

The `BlockTimeController` observes the current view rate and adjusts the timing when the proposal should be released.
It is a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller). The essential idea is to take into account the
current error, the rate of change of the error, and the cumulative error, when determining how much compensation to apply.
The compensation function $u[v]$ has three terms:

- $P[v]$ compensates proportionally to the magnitude of the instantaneous error
- $I[v]$ compensates proportionally to the magnitude of the error and how long it has persisted
- $D[v]$ compensates proportionally to the rate of change of the error


ðŸ“š This document uses ideas from:

- the paper [Fast self-tuning PID controller specially suited for mini robots](https://www.frba.utn.edu.ar/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EWMA_PID_7-1.pdf)
- the â€˜Leaky Integratorâ€™ [[forum discussion](https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29833/limiting-the-integral-to-a-time-window-in-pid-controller), [technical background](https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/307/week2/node4.html)]


### Choice of Process Variable: Targeted Epoch Switchover Time

The process variable is the variable which:

- has a target desired value, or setpoint ($SP$)
- is successively measured by the controller to compute the error $e$

---
ðŸ‘‰ The `BlockTimeController` controls the progression through views, such that the epoch switchover happens at the intended point in time. We define:

- $\gamma = k\cdot \tau_0$ is the remaining epoch duration of a hypothetical ideal system, where *all* remaining $k$ views of the epoch progress with the ideal view time  $\tau_0$.
- $\gamma = k\cdot \tau_0$ is the remaining epoch duration of a hypothetical ideal system, where *all* remaining $k$ views of the epoch progress with the ideal view time  $\tau_0$.
- The parameter $\tau_0$ is computed solely based on the Epoch configuration as
  $\tau_0 := \frac{<{\rm total\ epoch\ time}>}{<{\rm total\ views\ in\ epoch}>}$ (for mainnet 22, Epoch 75, we have $\tau_0 \simeq$  1250ms).
- $\Gamma$ is the *actual* time remaining until the desired epoch switchover.

The error, which the controller should drive towards zero, is defined as:

```math
e := \gamma - \Gamma
```
---


From our definition it follows that:

- $e > 0$  implies that the estimated epoch switchover (assuming ideal system behaviour) happens too late. Therefore, to hit the desired epoch switchover time, the time we spend in views has to be *smaller* than $\tau_0$.
- For $e < 0$  means that we estimate the epoch switchover to be too early. Therefore, we should be slowing down and spend more than $\tau_0$ in the following views.

**Reasoning:** 

The desired idealized system behaviour would a constant view duration $\tau_0$ throughout the entire epoch.

However, in the real-world system we have disturbances (varying message relay times, slow or offline nodes, etc) and measurement uncertainty (node can only observe its local view times, but not the committeeâ€™s collective swarm behaviour).

After a disturbance, we want the controller to drive the system back to a state, where it can closely follow the ideal behaviour from there on. 

- Simulations have shown that this approach produces *very* stable controller with the intended behaviour.
    
    **Controller driving  $e := \gamma - \Gamma \rightarrow 0$**
    - setting the differential term $K_d=0$, the controller responds as expected with damped oscillatory behaviour
      to a singular strong disturbance. Setting $K_d=3$ suppresses oscillations and the controller's performance improves as it responds more effectively.

    - controller very quickly compensates for moderate disturbances and observational noise in a well-behaved system:

    - controller compensates massive anomaly (100s network partition) effectively:

    - controller effectively stabilizes system with continued larger disturbances (20% of offline consensus participants) and notable observational noise:

# Detailed PID controller specification

Each consensus participant runs a local instance of the controller described below. Hence, all the quantities are based on the nodeâ€™s local observation.

## Definitions

**Observables** (quantities provided to the node or directly measurable by the node):

- $v$ is the nodeâ€™s current view
- ideal view time $\tau_0$ is computed solely based on the Epoch configuration:
$\tau_0 := \frac{<{\rm total\ epoch\ time}>}{<{\rm total\ views\ in\ epoch}>}$  (for mainnet 22, Epoch 75, we have $\tau_0 \simeq$  1250ms).
- $t[v]$ is the time the node entered view $v$
- $F[v]$  is the final view of the current epoch
- $T[v]$ is the target end time of the current epoch

**Derived quantities**

- remaining views of the epoch $k[v] := F[v] +1 - v$
- time remaining until the desired epoch switchover $\Gamma[v] := T[v]-t[v]$
- error $e[v] := \underbrace{k\cdot\tau_0}_{\gamma[v]} - \Gamma[v] = t[v] + k\cdot\tau_0 - T[v]$

### Precise convention of View Timing

Upon observing block `B` with view $v$, the controller updates its internal state. 

Note the '+1' term in the computation of the remaining views $k[v] := F[v] +1 - v$  . This is related to our convention that the epoch begins (happy path) when observing the first block of the epoch. Only by observing this block, the nodes transition to the first view of the epoch. Up to that point, the consensus replicas remain in the last view of the previous epoch, in the state of `having processed the last block of the old epoch and voted for it` (happy path). Replicas remain in this state until they see a confirmation of the view (either QC or TC for the last view of the previous epoch). 

![](/docs/CruiseControl_BlockTimeController/ViewDurationConvention.png)

In accordance with this convention, observing the proposal for the last view of an epoch, marks the start of the last view. By observing the proposal, nodes enter the last view, verify the block, vote for it, the primary aggregates the votes, constructs the child (for first view of new epoch). The last view of the epoch ends, when the child proposal is published.

### Controller

The goal of the controller is to drive the system towards an error of zero, i.e. $e[v] \rightarrow 0$. For a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller), the output $u$ for view $v$ has the form: 

```math
u[v] = K_p \cdot e[v]+K_i \cdot \mathcal{I}[v] + K_d \cdot \Delta[v]
```

With error terms (computed from observations)

- $e[v]$ representing the *instantaneous* error as of view $v$
(commonly referred to as â€˜proportional termâ€™)
- $\mathcal{I} [v] = \sum_v e[v]$ the sum of the errors
(commonly referred to as â€˜integral termâ€™)
- $\Delta[v]=e[v]-e[v-1]$ the rate of change of the error
(commonly referred to as â€˜derivative termâ€™)

and controller parameters (values derived from controller tuning): 

- $K_p$ be the proportional coefficient
- $K_i$ be the integral coefficient
- $K_d$ be the derivative coefficient

## Measuring view duration

Each consensus participant observes the error $e[v]$ based on its local view evolution. As the following figure illustrates, the view duration is highly variable on small time scales.

![](/docs/CruiseControl_BlockTimeController/ViewRate.png)

Therefore, we expect $e[v]$ to be very variable. Furthermore, note that a node uses its local view transition times as an estimator for the collective behaviour of the entire committee. Therefore, there is also observational noise obfuscating the underlying collective behaviour. Hence, we expect notable noise. 

## Managing noise

Noisy values for $e[v]$ also impact the derivative term $\Delta[v]$ and integral term $\mathcal{I}[v]$. This can impact the controllerâ€™s performance.

### **Managing noise in the proportional term**

An established approach for managing noise in observables is to use [exponentially weighted moving average [EWMA]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) instead of the instantaneous values.  Specifically, let $\bar{e}[v]$ denote the EWMA of the instantaneous error, which is computed as follows:

```math
\eqalign{
\textnormal{initialization: }\quad \bar{e} :&= 0 \\
\textnormal{update with instantaneous error\ } e[v]:\quad \bar{e}[v] &= \alpha \cdot e[v] + (1-\alpha)\cdot \bar{e}[v-1]
}
```

The parameter $\alpha$ relates to the averaging time window. Let $\alpha \equiv \frac{1}{N_\textnormal{ewma}}$ and consider that the input changes from $x_\textnormal{old}$ to $x_\textnormal{new}$ as a step function. Then $N_\textnormal{ewma}$ is the number of samples required to move the output average about 2/3 of the way from  $x_\textnormal{old}$ to $x_\textnormal{new}$.

see also [Python `Ewma` implementation](https://github.com/dapperlabs/flow-internal/blob/423d927421c073e4c3f66165d8f51b829925278f/analyses/pacemaker_timing/2023-05_Blocktime_PID-controller/controller_tuning_v01.py#L405-L431)

### **Managing noise in the integral term**

In particular systematic observation bias are a problem, as it leads to a diverging integral term. The commonly adopted approach is to use a â€˜leaky integratorâ€™ [[1](https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/307/week2/node4.html), [2](https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29833/limiting-the-integral-to-a-time-window-in-pid-controller)], which we denote as $\bar{\mathcal{I}}[v]$. 

```math
\eqalign{
\textnormal{initialization: }\quad \bar{\mathcal{I}} :&= 0 \\
\textnormal{update with instantaneous error\ } e[v]:\quad \bar{\mathcal{I}}[v] &= e[v] + (1-\beta)\cdot\bar{\mathcal{I}}[v-1]
}
```

Intuitively, the loss factor $\beta$ relates to the time window of the integrator. A factor of 0 means an infinite time horizon, while $\beta =1$  makes the integrator only memorize the last input. Let  $\beta \equiv \frac{1}{N_\textnormal{itg}}$ and consider a constant input value $x$. Then $N_\textnormal{itg}$ relates to the number of past samples that the integrator remembers: 

- the integrators output will saturate at $x\cdot N_\textnormal{itg}$
- an integrator initialized with 0, reaches 2/3 of the saturation value $x\cdot N_\textnormal{itg}$ after consuming $N_\textnormal{itg}$ inputs

see also [Python `LeakyIntegrator` implementation](https://github.com/dapperlabs/flow-internal/blob/423d927421c073e4c3f66165d8f51b829925278f/analyses/pacemaker_timing/2023-05_Blocktime_PID-controller/controller_tuning_v01.py#L444-L468)

### **Managing noise in the derivative term**

Similarly to the proportional term, we apply an EWMA to the differential term and denote the averaged value as $\bar{\Delta}[v]$:

```math
\eqalign{
\textnormal{initialization: }\quad \bar{\Delta} :&= 0 \\
\textnormal{update with instantaneous error\ } e[v]:\quad \bar{\Delta}[v] &= \bar{e}[v] - \bar{e}[v-1]
}
```

## Final formula for PID controller

We have used a statistical model of the view duration extracted from mainnet 22 (Epoch 75) and manually added disturbances and observational noise and systemic observational bias.

The following parameters have proven to generate stable controller behaviour over a large variety of network conditions:

---
ðŸ‘‰ The controller is given by

```math
u[v] = K_p \cdot \bar{e}[v]+K_i \cdot \bar{\mathcal{I}}[v] + K_d \cdot \bar{\Delta}[v]
```

with parameters:

- $K_p = 2.0$
- $K_i = 0.6$
- $K_d = 3.0$
- $N_\textnormal{ewma} = 5$, i.e. $\alpha = \frac{1}{N_\textnormal{ewma}} = 0.2$
- $N_\textnormal{itg} = 50$, i.e.  $\beta = \frac{1}{N_\textnormal{itg}} = 0.02$
    
The controller output $u[v]$ represents the amount of time by which the controller wishes to deviate from the ideal view duration $\tau_0$. In other words, the duration of view $v$ that the controller wants to set is
```math
\widehat{\tau}[v] = \tau_0 - u[v]
```
---

### Limits of authority

In general, there is no bound on the output of the controller output $u$. However, it is important to limit the controllerâ€™s influence to keep $u$ within a sensible range.

- upper bound on view duration $\widehat{\tau}[v]$ that we allow the controller to set:
  
  The current timeout threshold is set to 2.5s. Therefore, the largest view duration we want to allow the  controller to set is 1.6s.
  Thereby, approx. 900ms remain for message propagation, voting and constructing the child block, which will prevent the controller to drive the node into timeout with high probability. 
    
- lower bound on the view duration:
    
  Let $t_\textnormal{p}[v]$ denote the time when the primary for view $v$ has constructed its block proposal. 
  The time difference $t_\textnormal{p}[v] - t[v]$ between the primary entering the view and having its proposal
  ready is the minimally required time to execute the protocol. The controller can only *delay* broadcasting the block,
  but it cannot release the block before  $t_\textnormal{p}[v]$ simply because the proposal isnâ€™t ready any earlier. 
    


ðŸ‘‰ Let $\hat{t}[v]$ denote the time when the primary for view $v$ *broadcasts* its proposal. We assign:

```math
\hat{t}[v] := \max\big(t[v] +\min(\widehat{\tau}[v],\ 2\textnormal{s}),\  t_\textnormal{p}[v]\big) 
```



## Edge Cases

### A node is catching up

When a node is catching up, it processes blocks more quickly than when it is up-to-date, and therefore observes a faster view rate. This would cause the nodeâ€™s `BlockRateManager` to compensate by increasing the block rate delay.

As long as delay function is responsive, it doesnâ€™t have a practical impact, because nodes catching up donâ€™t propose anyway.

To the extent the delay function is not responsive, this would cause the block rate to slow down slightly, when the node is caught up. 

**Assumption:** as we assume that only a smaller fraction of nodes go offline, the effect is expected to be small and easily compensated for by the supermajority of online nodes.

### A node has a misconfigured clock

Cap the maximum deviation from the default delay (limits the general impact of error introduced by the `BlockTimeController`). The node with misconfigured clock will contribute to the error in a limited way, but as long as the majority of nodes have an accurate clock, they will offset this error. 

**Assumption:** few enough nodes will have a misconfigured clock, that the effect will be small enough to be easily compensated for by the supermajority of correct nodes.

### Near epoch boundaries

We might incorrectly compute high error in the target view rate, if local current view and current epoch are not exactly synchronized. By default, they would not be, because `EpochTransition` events occur upon finalization, and current view is updated as soon as QC/TC is available.

**Solution:** determine epoch locally based on view only, do not use `EpochTransition` event.

### EFM

We need to detect EFM and revert to a default block-rate-delay (stop adjusting).
