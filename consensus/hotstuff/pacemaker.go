// PaceMaker for HotStuff. The component is passive in that it only reacts to method calls.
// The PaceMaker does not perform state transitions on its own. Timeouts are emitted through
// channels. Each timeout has its own dedicated channel, which is garbage collected after the
// respective state has been passed. It is the EventHandler's responsibility to pick up
// timeouts from the currently active TimeoutChannel process them first and subsequently inform the
// PaceMaker about processing the timeout. Specifically, the intended usage pattern for the
// TimeoutChannels is as follows:
//
// • Each time the PaceMaker starts a new timeout, it created a new TimeoutChannel
//
// • The channel for the CURRENTLY ACTIVE timeout is returned by PaceMaker.TimeoutChannel()
//
// • Each time the EventHandler processes an event, the EventHandler might call into PaceMaker
//   potentially resulting in a state transition and the PaceMaker starting a new timeout
//
// • Hence, after processing any event, EventHandler should retrieve the current TimeoutChannel
//   from the PaceMaker.
//
// For Example:
//
// for {
//		timeoutChannel := el.eventHandler.TimeoutChannel()
//		select {
//		   case <-timeoutChannel:
//		    	el.eventHandler.OnLocalTimeout()
//		   case <other events>
//		}
// }
