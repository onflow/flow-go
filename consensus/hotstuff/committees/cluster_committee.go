// votingClusterParticipants extends the IdentitySkeletons of the cluster members to their full Identities
// at the time of cluster initialization by EpochSetup event.
// IMPORTANT CONVENTIONS:
//  1. clusterMembers with zero `InitialWeight` are _not included_ as "contributing" cluster participants.
//     In accordance with their zero weight, they cannot contribute to advancing the cluster consensus.
//     For example, the consensus leader selection allows zero-weighted nodes among the weighted participants,
//     but these nodes have zero probability to be selected as leader. Similarly, they cannot meaningfully contribute
//     votes or Timeouts to QCs or TC, due to their zero weight. Therefore, we do not consider them a valid signer.
//  2. This operation maintains the relative order. In other words, if `clusterMembers` is in canonical order,
//     then the output `IdentityList` is also canonically ordered.
//
// CONTEXT: The EpochSetup event contains the IdentitySkeletons for each cluster, thereby specifying cluster membership.
// While ejection status is not part of the EpochSetup event, we can supplement this information as follows:
//   - Per convention, service events are delivered (asynchronously) in an *order-preserving* manner. Furthermore,
//     node ejection is also mediated by system smart contracts and delivered via service events.
//   - Therefore, the EpochSetup event contains the up-to-date snapshot of the cluster members. Any node ejection
//     that happened before should be reflected in the EpochSetup event. Specifically, ejected nodes
//     should be no longer listed in the EpochSetup event. Hence, when the EpochSetup event is emitted / processed,
//     the participation status of all cluster members equals flow.EpochParticipationStatusActive.
