	// It allows concurrent verification of the given signature.
	// Returns :

	// are returned) through a post-check (verifying the threshold signature
	// _after_ reconstruction before returning it).
	// The function is thread-safe but locks its internal state, thereby permitting only
	// one routine at a time to add a signature.

	//  - (false, nil) if the signature has been added, but not enough shares were collected.

	//    or if the constructed signature failed to verify against the group public key and stored message. This post-verification
	//    is required  for safety, as `TrustedAdd` allows adding invalid signatures.
