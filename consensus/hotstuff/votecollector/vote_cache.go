//     The consensus replica has emitted inconsistent votes within the same view, which

//     replica is voting for different blocks at the same view or using different signing information.

//   - [model.DoubleVoteError] indicates that the voter has emitted inconsistent
//     votes within the same view. We consider two votes as inconsistent, if they
//     are from the same signer for the same view, but have different IDs. Potential
//     causes could be:
//   - The signer voted for different blocks in the same view.
//   - The signer emitted votes for the same block, but included different
//     signatures. This is only relevant for voting schemes where the signer has
//     different options how to sign (e.g. sign with staking key and/or random
//     beacon key). For such voting schemes, byzantine replicas could try to
//     submit different votes for the same block, to exhaust the primary's
//     resources or have multiple of their votes counted to undermine consensus
//     safety (aka double-counting attack).
//     Both are protocol violations and belong to the family of equivocation attacks.
//     As part of the error, we return the internally-cached vote, which is conflicting
//     with the input `vote`.
//   - [RepeatedVoteErr] is returned when adding a vote that is _identical_ (same ID)
