// scheme (e.g. for main consensus, or collector clusters), a different baseFactory can
// be used.
// CAUTION: the baseFactory creates the VerifyingVoteProcessor for the given block. It
// does _not_ check the proposer's vote for its own block. The API reflects this by
// expecting a `model.Block` as input (which does _not_ contain the proposer vote) as
// opposed to `model.Proposal` (combines block with proposer's vote).
// Therefore, baseFactory does _not_ implement `hotstuff.VoteProcessorFactory` by itself.
// The VoteProcessorFactory adds the missing logic to verify the proposer's vote, by
// wrapping the baseFactory (decorator pattern).
