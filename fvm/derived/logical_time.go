// Execution time refers to the transaction's start time.  Snapshot time refers
// to the time when the snapshot first becomes readable (i.e., the "snapshot
// time - 1" transaction committed the snapshot view).  The snapshot is where
// the derived value is computed from if no cached value is available.
// Each transaction's snapshot time must be smaller than or equal to its
// execution time.
//
// Normal transaction advances the time clock and must be committed to
// DerivedBlockData in monotonically increasing execution time order.
//
// Snapshot read transaction (aka script) does not advance the time clock.  Its
// execution and snapshot time must be set to the latest snapshot time (or
// EndOfBlockExecutionTime in case the real logical time is unavailable).
//
// Note that the "real" txIndex range is [0, math.MaxUint32], but we have
// expanded the range to support events that are not part of the block
// execution.
