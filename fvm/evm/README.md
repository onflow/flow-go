# Flow-EVM

This module represents the implementation of EVM embedded into Flow.

It makes use of a forked version of go-ethereum, located at https://github.com/onflow/go-ethereum

The genesis.json files that exist here serve as indication of the configurations used, but are not directly used during the configuration/setup/genesis of this particular EVM implementation.
