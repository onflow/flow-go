/*

    The Flow EVM contract defines important types and functionality
    to allow Cadence code and Flow SDKs to interface
    with the Etherem Virtual Machine environment on Flow.

    The EVM contract emits events when relevant actions happen in Flow EVM
    such as creating new blocks, executing transactions, and bridging FLOW

    This contract also defines Cadence-Owned Account functionality,
    which is currently the only way for Cadence code to interact with Flow EVM.

    Additionally, functionality is provided for common EVM types
    such as addresses, balances, ABIs, transaction results, and more.

    The EVM contract is deployed to the Flow Service Account on every network
    and many of its functionality is directly connected to the protocol software
    to allow interaction with the EVM.

    See additional EVM documentation here: https://developers.flow.com/evm/about

        Cadence-Owned Accounts (COA) 
        A COA is a natively supported EVM smart contract wallet type 
        that allows a Cadence resource to own and control an EVM address.
        This native wallet provides the primitives needed to bridge
        or control assets across Flow EVM and Cadence.
        From the EVM perspective, COAs are smart contract wallets
        that accept native token transfers and support several ERCs
        including ERC-165, ERC-721, ERC-777, ERC-1155, ERC-1271.

        COAs are not controlled by a key.
        Instead, every COA account has a unique resource accessible
        on the Cadence side, and anyone who owns that resource submits transactions
        on behalf of this address. These direct transactions have COA’s EVM address
        as the tx.origin and a new EVM transaction type (TxType = 0xff)
        is used to differentiate these transactions from other types
        of EVM transactions (e.g, DynamicFeeTxType (0x02).

        Because of this, users are never able to access a key for their account,
        meaning that they cannot control their COA's address on other EVM blockchains.
