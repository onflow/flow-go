// EVM is an account inside FVM with special access to the underlying infrastructure
// which allows to run a virtual EVM-based blockchain inside FVM.
//
// There are two ways to interact with this environment:
//
// First, passing a signed transaction (EOA account) to the `EVM.run` Cadence function
// creates a new block, updates the internal merkle tree, and emits a new root hash.
//
// The Second way is through a new form of account called bridged accounts,
// which is represented and controlled through a resource, owned by a Flow account.
// The owner of the bridged account resource can interact with the evm environment on behalf of the address stored on the resource.
//
// The evm environment shares the same native token as Flow, there are no new tokens minted.
// Other ERC-20 fungible tokens can be bridged between bridged account resources and Flow accounts.

// ContractHandler handles operations on the evm environment

	// if isAuthorized is set, it allows for functionality like `call`, `deploy`
	// should only be set for bridged accounts only.
