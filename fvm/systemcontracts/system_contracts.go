// Package systemcontracts stores canonical address locations for all system
// smart contracts and service events.
//
// System contracts are special smart contracts controlled by the service account,
// a Flow account with special privileges to administer the network.
//
// Service events are special events defined within system contracts which
// are included within execution receipts and processed by the consensus committee
// to enable message-passing to the protocol state.
//
// For transient networks, all system contracts can be deployed to the service
// account. For long-lived networks, system contracts are spread across several
// accounts for historical reasons.
