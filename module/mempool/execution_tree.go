// ExecutionTree represents a concurrency-safe memory pool for execution
// Receipts. Its is aware of the tree structure formed by execution results.
// All execution receipts for the _same result_ form an equivalence class and
// are represented by _one_ vertex in the execution tree. The mempool utilizes
// knowledge about the height of the block the result is for. Hence, the
// Mempool can only store and process Receipts whose block is known.
//
// Implementations are concurrency safe.

	// AddResult adds an Execution Result to the Execution Tree (without any receipts), in
	// case the result is not already stored in the tree.
	// This is useful for crash recovery:
	// After recovering from a crash, the mempools are wiped and the sealed results will not
	// be stored in the Execution Tree anymore. Adding the result to the tree allows to create
	// a vertex in the tree without attaching any Execution Receipts to it.

	// of the block the receipt is for. We enforce data consistency on an API
	// level by using the block header as input.

	// ReachableReceipts returns a slice of ExecutionReceipt, whose result
	// is computationally reachable from resultID. Context:
	// * Conceptually, the Execution results form a tree, which we refer to as
	//   Execution Tree. A branch in the execution can be due to a fork in the main
	//   chain. Furthermore, the execution branches if ENs disagree about the result
	//   for the same block.
	// * As the ID of an execution result contains the BlockID, which the result
	//   for, all Execution Results with the same ID necessarily are for the same
	//   block. All Execution Receipts committing to the same result from an
	//   equivalence class and can be represented as one vertex in the Execution
	//   Tree.
	// * An execution result r1 points (field ExecutionResult.ParentResultID) to
	//   its parent result r0 , whose end state was used as the starting state
	//   to compute r1. Formally, we have an edge r0 -> r1 in the Execution Tree,
	//   if a result r1 is stored in the mempool, whose ParentResultID points to
	//   r0.
	// ReachableReceipts implements a tree search on the Execution Tree starting
	// from the provided resultID. Execution Receipts are traversed in a
	// parent-first manner, meaning that a the parent result is traversed
	// _before_ any of its derived results. The algorithm only traverses to
	// results, for which there exists a sequence of interim result in the
	// mempool without any gaps.
	//
	// Two filters are supplied:
	// * blockFilter: the tree search will only travers to results for
	//   blocks which pass the filter. Often higher-level logic is only
	//   interested in results for blocks in a specific fork. Such can be
	//   implemented by a suitable blockFilter.
	// * receiptFilter: for a reachable result (subject to the restrictions
	//   imposed by blockFilter, all known receipts are returned.
	//   While _all_ Receipts for the parent result are guaranteed to be
	//   listed before the receipts for the derived results, there is no
	//   specific ordering for the receipts committing to the same result
	//   (random order). If only a subset of receipts for a result is desired
	//   (e.g. for de-duplication with parent blocks), receiptFilter should
	//   be used.
	// Note the important difference between the two filters:
	// * The blockFilter suppresses traversal to derived results.
	// * The receiptFilter does _not_ suppresses traversal to derived results.
	//   Only individual receipts are dropped.
	//
	// Error returns:
	// * UnknownExecutionResultError (sentinel) if resultID is unknown
	// * all other error are unexpected and potential indicators of corrupted internal state
