// ExecutionTree is a mempool holding receipts, which is aware of the tree structure
// formed by the results. The mempool supports pruning by height: only results
// descending from the latest sealed and finalized result are relevant. Hence, we
// can prune all results for blocks _below_ the latest block with a finalized seal.
// Results of sufficient height for forks that conflict with the finalized fork are
// retained. However, such orphaned forks do not grow anymore and their results
// will be progressively flushed out with increasing sealed-finalized height.
//
// Safe for concurrent access. Internally, the mempool utilizes the LevelledForrest.

// ReachableReceipts returns a slice of ExecutionReceipt, whose result

//  * Conceptually, the Execution results form a tree, which we refer to as
//    Execution Tree. A fork in the execution can be due to a fork in the main
//    chain. Furthermore, the execution forks if ENs disagree about the result
//    for the same block.
//  * As the ID of an execution result contains the BlockID, which the result
//    for, all Execution Results with the same ID necessarily are for the same
//    block. All Execution Receipts committing to the same result from an
//    equivalence class and can be represented as one vertex in the Execution
//    Tree.
//  * An execution result r1 points (field ExecutionResult.ParentResultID) to
//    its parent result r0 , whose end state was used as the starting state
//    to compute r1. Formally, we have an edge r0 -> r1 in the Execution Tree,
//    if a result r1 is stored in the mempool, whose ParentResultID points to
//    r0.
// ReachableReceipts traverses the Execution Tree from the provided resultID.
// Execution Receipts are traversed in a parent-first manner, meaning that
// a receipt committing to the parent result is traversed first _before_
// the receipt committing to the derived result.
// The algorithm only traverses to results, for which there exists a
// sequence of interim result in the mempool without any gaps.
//
// Error returns:
// * UnknownExecutionResultError (sentinel) if resultID is unknown
// * all other error are unexpected and potential indicators of corrupted internal state
