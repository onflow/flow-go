	Broadcast(msg messages.BroadcastDKGMessage) error

	// ReadBroadcast reads the broadcast messages from the smart contract.
	// Messages are returned in the order in which they were broadcast (received
	// and stored in the smart contract). The parameters are:
	//
	// * fromIndex: return messages with index >= fromIndex
	// * referenceBlock: a marker for the state against which the query should
	//   be executed

	// SubmitParametersAndResult posts the DKG setup parameters (`flow.DKGIndexMap`) and the node's locally-computed DKG result to
	// the DKG white-board smart contract. The DKG results are the node's local computation of the group public key and the public
	// key shares. Serialized public keys are encoded as lower-case hex strings.
	// Conceptually the flow.DKGIndexMap is not an output of the DKG protocol. Rather, it is part of the configuration/initialization
	// information of the DKG. Before an epoch transition on the happy path (using the data in the EpochSetup event), each consensus
	// participant locally fixes the DKG committee ùíü including the respective nodes' order to be identical to the consensus
	// committee ùíû. However, in case of a failed epoch transition, we desire the ability to manually provide the result of a successful
	// DKG for the immediately next epoch (so-called recovery epoch). The DKG committee ùíü must have a sufficiently large overlap with
	// the recovery epoch's consensus committee ùíû -- though for flexibility, we do *not* want to require that both committees are identical.
	// Therefore, we need to explicitly specify the DKG committee ùíü on the fallback path. For uniformity of implementation, we do the
	// same also on the happy path.

	// SubmitEmptyResult submits an empty result of the DKG protocol.
	// The empty result is obtained by a node when it realizes locally that its DKG participation
	// was unsuccessful (possible reasons include: node received too many byzantine inputs;
	// node has networking issues; locally computed key is invalid‚Ä¶). However, a node obtaining an
	// empty result can happen in both cases of the DKG succeeding or failing globally.

	// Honest nodes would call `SubmitEmptyResult` strictly after the final phase has ended if DKG has ended.
