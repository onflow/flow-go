# Flow Cryptography

This Go package provides the cryptography tools needed by Flow blockchain.  
Most of the primitives and protocols can be used in other projects and are not specific to Flow.

Flow is an ongoing project, which means that new features will still be added and modifications will still be made to improve security and performance of the cryptography package.

NOTE: This package does not provide any security against side channel or tampering attacks.

## Package import

Cloning Flow repository and following the [installation steps](https://github.com/dapperlabs/flow-go) builds the necessary tools to use Flow cryptography. 

If you only wish to import the Flow cryptography package to your Go project, please follow the following steps:

- Get Flow cryptography package.
```
go get github.com/dapperlabs/flow-go/crypto (to be updated to the new repo)
```
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/), which is used for building the package.
- From the package directory in `$GOPATH/pkg/mod/`, build the package dependencies.
```
go generate
```

## Algorithms

### Hashing and Message Authentication Code:

`crypto/hash` provides the hashing and MAC algorithms required for Flow. All algorithm implement the generic interface `Hasher`. All digests are of the generic type `Hash`.

*Hashing* :
 * Sha3: 256 and 384 output sizes
 * Sha2: 256 and 384 output sizes

*MAC* :
 * KMAC: 128 variant

### Signature schemes 

All signature schemes use the generic interfaces of `PrivateKey` and `PublicKey`. All signatures are of the generic type `Signature`.

 * ECDSA
    * public keys are uncompressed.
    * ephemeral key is derived from the private key, hash and an external entropy using a CSPRNG (based on https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/ecdsa/).
    * supports NIST P-256 (secp256r1) and secp256k1 curves.

 * BLS
    * supports [BLS 12-381](https://github.com/zkcrypto/pairing/blob/master/src/bls12_381/README.md) curve.
    * is optimized for shorter signatures (on G1) 
    * public keys are longer (on G2)
    * supports [compressed](https://github.com/zkcrypto/pairing/blob/master/src/bls12_381/README.md#serialization) and uncompressed serialization of G1/G2 points.
    * hash to curve is using the [optimized SWU map](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/403.pdf).
    * expanding the message is using KMAC 128 with a domain separation tag.
    * signature verification includes the signature membership check in G1. 
    * public key membership check in G2 is provided outside signature verification.
    * membership check in G1 is using [Bowe's fast check](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/814.pdf), while membership check in G2 is using a simple scalar multiplication by the group order.
    * non-interactive aggregation of signatures, public keys and private keys.
    * multi-signature verification of an aggregated signature of a single message under multiple public keys.

 * Future features:
    * more tools for BLS multi signature and batch verification
    * membership checks in G2 using [Bowe's method](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/814.pdf)
    * support a G1/G2 swap (signatures on G2 and public keys on G1)
 
### PRNG

 * Xorshift128+

## Protocols

### Threshold Signature

 * BLS-based threshold signature 
    * [non interactive](https://www.iacr.org/archive/pkc2003/25670031/25670031.pdf) threshold signature reconstruction.
    * supports only BLS 12-381 curve with the same features above.
    * the threshold value (t) if fixed to t = floor((n-1)/2) for an optimal unforgeabiliyty and robustness.
    * (t+1) signatures are required to reconstruct the threshold signature.
    * a centralized key generation is provided.
    * provides a stateless api and a stateful api. 

 * Future features:
    * the threshold value (t) is an input parameter.
    * support a partial signature reconstruction in the stateful api to avoid a long final reconstruction. 


### Discrete-Log based distributed key generation

All supported Distributed Key Generation protocols are [discrete log based](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.50.2737&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and are implemented for the same BLS setup on the BLS 12-381 curve. The protocols generate key sets for the BLS-based threshold signature. 

 * Feldman VSS
    * simple centralized verifiable secret sharing
    * the threshold value (t) if fixed to t = floor((n-1)/2) for an optimal unforgeabiliyty and robustness.
    * 1-to-1 messaging is not encrypted, the caller must make sure the 1-to-1 messaging channel preserves confidentialiy. 
    * 1-to-n broadcasting assume all destination nodes receive the same copy of the message.
 * Feldman VSS Qual
    * based on Feldman VSS.
    * implements a complaint mechanism to qualify/disqualify the leader.
 * Joint Feldman (Pedersen)
    * decentralized generation
    * based on multiple parallel instances of Feldman VSS Qual with multiple leaders.
    * same assumptions about the 1-to-1 and 1-to-n messaging channels as Feldman VSS.
