# Insecure Package

The insecure package encapsulates tools and technologies related to testing codebase against
attack vectors of malicious nodes. The package and sub-packages namings are chosen in a way that reflect
this purpose. This package should not be utilized for any production-grade development that affects
production networks such as the `mainnet`.
