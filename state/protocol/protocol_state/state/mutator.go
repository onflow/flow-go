// stateMutator is a stateful object to evolve the protocol state. It is instantiated from the parent block's protocol state.
// State-changing operations can be iteratively applied and the stateMutator will internally evolve its in-memory state.
// While the StateMutator does not modify the database, it internally tracks the necessary database updates to persist its
// dependencies (specifically EpochSetup and EpochCommit events). Upon calling `Build` the stateMutator returns the updated
// protocol state, its ID and all database updates necessary for persisting the updated protocol state.
//
// The StateMutator is used by a replica's compliance layer to update protocol state when observing state-changing service in
// blocks. It is used by the primary in the block building process to obtain the correct protocol state for a proposal.
// Specifically, the leader may include state-changing service events in the block payload. The flow protocol prescribes that
// the proposal needs to include the ID of the protocol state, _after_ processing the payload incl. all state-changing events.
// Therefore, the leader instantiates a StateMutator, applies the service events to it and builds the updated protocol state ID.
//
// Not safe for concurrent use.

// ApplyServiceEventsFromValidatedSeals applies the state changes that are delivered via
// sealed service events:
//   - iterating over the sealed service events in order of increasing height
//   - identifying state-changing service event and calling into the embedded
//     StateMachine to apply the respective state update
//   - tracking deferred database updates necessary to persist the updated
//     protocol state's *dependencies*. Persisting and indexing `updatedState`
//     is the responsibility of the calling code (specifically `FollowerState`)
//
// All updates only mutate the `StateMutator`'s internal in-memory copy of the
// protocol state, without changing the parent state (i.e. the state we started from).
//
// SAFETY REQUIREMENT:
// The StateMutator assumes that the proposal has passed the following correctness checks!
//   - The seals in the payload continuously follow the ancestry of this fork. Specifically,
//     there are no gaps in the seals.
//   - The seals guarantee correctness of the sealed execution result, including the contained
//     service events. This is actively checked by the verification node, whose aggregated
//     approvals in the form of a seal attest to the correctness of the sealed execution result,
//     including the contained.
//
// Consensus nodes actively verify protocol compliance for any block proposal they receive,
// including integrity of each seal individually as well as the seals continuously following the
// fork. Light clients only process certified blocks, which guarantees that consensus nodes already
// ran those checks and found the proposal to be valid.
//
// Details on SERVICE EVENTS:
// Consider a chain where a service event is emitted during execution of block A.
// Block B contains an execution receipt for A. Block C contains a seal for block
// A's execution result.
//
//	A <- .. <- B(RA) <- .. <- C(SA)
//
// Service Events are included within execution results, which are stored
// opaquely as part of the block payload in block B. We only validate, process and persist
// the typed service event to storage once we process C, the block containing the
// seal for block A. This is because we rely on the sealing subsystem to validate
// correctness of the service event before processing it.
// Consequently, any change to the protocol state introduced by a service event
// emitted during execution of block A would only become visible when querying
// C or its descendants.
//
// Error returns:
//   - Per convention, the input seals from the block payload have already been confirmed to be protocol compliant.
//     Hence, the service events in the sealed execution results represent the honest execution path.
//     Therefore, the sealed service events should encode a valid evolution of the protocol state -- provided
//     the system smart contracts are correct.
//   - As we can rule out byzantine attacks as the source of failures, the only remaining sources of problems
//     can be (a) bugs in the system smart contracts or (b) bugs in the node implementation.
//     A service event not representing a valid state transition despite all consistency checks passing
//     is interpreted as case (a) and handled internally within the StateMutator. In short, we go into Epoch
//     Fallback Mode by copying the parent state (a valid state snapshot) and setting the
//     `InvalidEpochTransitionAttempted` flag. All subsequent Epoch-lifecycle events are ignored.
//   - A consistency or sanity check failing within the StateMutator is likely the symptom of an internal bug
//     in the node software or state corruption, i.e. case (b). This is the only scenario where the error return
//     of this function is not nil. If such an exception is returned, continuing is not an option.
