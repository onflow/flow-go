// OrthogonalStoreStateMachine represents a state machine, that exclusively evolves its state P.
// The state's specific type P is kept as a generic. Generally, P is the type corresponding
// to one specific key in the Key-Value store.
//
// The Flow protocol defines its protocol state 𝓅 as the composition of disjoint sub-states P0, P1, ..., Pj
// Formally, we write 𝒫 = P0 ⊗ P1 ⊗  ... ⊗ Pj, where '⊗' denotes the product state. We loosely associate
// each P0, P1 ... with one specific key-value entry in the store. Correspondingly, we have one conceptually
// independent state machine S0, S1, ... operating each on their own respective element P0, P1, ...
// A one-to-one correspondence between kv-entry and state machine should be the default, but is not
// strictly required. However, the strong requirement is that no entry is operated on my more than one
// state machine.
//
// Orthogonal State Machines:
// Orthogonality means that state machines can operate completely independently and work on disjoint
// sub-states. They all consume the same inputs: the ordered sequence of Service Events sealed in one block.
// In other words, each state machine S0, S1, ... has full visibility, but each draws their on independent
// conclusions (maintain their own exclusive state).
// This is a deliberate design choice. Thereby the default is favouring modularity and strong logical
// independence. This is very beneficial for managing complexity in the long term.
// We emphasize that this architecture choice does not prevent us of from implementing sequential state
// machines for certain events. It is just that we would need to bundle these sequential state machines
// into a composite state machine (conceptually a processing pipeline).
//
// Formally we write:
//   - The overall protocol state 𝒫 is composed of disjoint substates 𝒫 = P0 ⊗ P1 ⊗  ... ⊗ Pj
//   - For each state Pi, we have a dedicated state machine Si that exclusively operates on Pi
//   - The state machines can be formalized as orthogonal regions of the composite state machine
//     𝒮 = S0 ⊗ S1 ⊗  ... ⊗ Sj. (Technically, we represent the state machine by its state-transition
//     function. All other details of the state machine are implicit.)
//   - The state machine 𝒮 being in state 𝒫 and observing the input ξ = x0·x1·x2·..·xz will output
//     state 𝒫'. To emphasize that a certain state machine 𝒮 exclusively operates on state 𝒫, we write
//     𝒮[𝒫] = S0[P0] ⊗ S1[P1] ⊗ ... ⊗ Sj[Pj]
//     Observing the events ξ the output state 𝒫' is
//     𝒫' = 𝒮[𝒫](ξ) = S0[P0](ξ) ⊗ S1[P1](ξ) ⊗ ... ⊗ Sj[Pj](ξ) = P'0 ⊗ P'1 ⊗  ... ⊗ P'j
//     Where each state machine Si individually generated the output state Si[Pi](ξ) = P'i
//
// The Protocol State is the framework, which orchestrates the orthogonal state machines,
// feeds them with inputs, post-processes the outputs and overall manages state machines' life-cycle
// from block to block. New key-value pairs and corresponding state machines can easily be added
// by implementing the following interface (state machine) and adding a new entry to the KV store.
