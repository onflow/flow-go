// HappyPathStateMachine is a dedicated structure for evolving the Epoch-related portion of the overall Protocol State.
// Based on the content of a new block, it updates epoch data, including the identity table, on the happy path.
// The HappyPathStateMachine guarantees protocol-compliant evolution of Epoch-related sub-state via the
// following state transitions:
//   - epoch setup: transitions current epoch from staking to setup phase, creates next epoch protocol state when processed.
//   - epoch commit: transitions current epoch from setup to commit phase, commits next epoch protocol state when processed.
//   - epoch transition: on the first block of the new epoch (Formally, the block's parent is still in the last epoch,
//     while the new block has a view in the next epoch. Caution: the block's view is not necessarily the first view
//     in the epoch, as there might be leader failures)
//   - identity changes: updates identity table for previous (if available), current, and next epoch (if available).
//
// All updates are applied to a copy of parent protocol state, so parent protocol state is not modified. The stateMachine internally
// tracks the current protocol state. A separate instance should be created for each block to processing the updates therein.

	// When observing setup event for subsequent epoch, construct the EpochStateContainer for `ProtocolStateEntry.NextEpoch`.
	// Context:
	// Note that the `EpochStateContainer.ActiveIdentities` only contains the nodes that are *active* in the next epoch. Active means
	// that these nodes are authorized to contribute to extending the chain. Nodes are listed in `ActiveIdentities` if and only if
	// they are part of the EpochSetup event for the respective epoch.
	//
	// sanity checking SAFETY-CRITICAL INVARIANT (I):
	//   - Per convention, the `flow.EpochSetup` event should list the IdentitySkeletons in canonical order. This is useful
	//     for most efficient construction of the full active Identities for an epoch. We enforce this here at the gateway
	//     to the protocol state, when we incorporate new information from the EpochSetup event.
	//   - Note that the system smart contracts manage the identity table as an unordered set! For the protocol state, we desire a fixed
	//     ordering to simplify various implementation details, like the DKG. Therefore, we order identities in `flow.EpochSetup` during
	//     conversion from cadence to Go in the function `convert.ServiceEvent(flow.ChainID, flow.Event)` in package `model/convert`
	// sanity checking SAFETY-CRITICAL INVARIANT (II):
	// While ejection status and dynamic weight are not part of the EpochSetup event, we can supplement this information as follows:
	//   - Per convention, service events are delivered (asynchronously) in an *order-preserving* manner. Furthermore, weight changes or
	//     node ejection is entirely mediated by system smart contracts and delivered via service events.
	//   - Therefore, the EpochSetup event contains the up-to-date snapshot of the epoch participants. Any weight changes or node ejection
	//     that happened before should be reflected in the EpochSetup event. Specifically, the initial weight should be reduced and ejected
	//     nodes should be no longer listed in the EpochSetup event.
	//   - Hence, the following invariant must be satisfied by the system smart contracts for all active nodes in the upcoming epoch:
	//      (i) The Ejected flag is false. Node X being ejected in epoch N (necessarily via a service event emitted by the system
	//          smart contracts earlier) but also being listed in the setup event for the subsequent epoch (service event emitted by
	//          the system smart contracts later) is illegal.
	//     (ii) When the EpochSetup event is emitted / processed, the weight of all active nodes equals their InitialWeight and

	// For collector clusters, we rely on invariants (I) and (II) holding. See `committees.Cluster` for details, specifically function
	// `constructInitialClusterIdentities(..)`. While the system smart contract must satisfy this invariant, we run a sanity check below.
