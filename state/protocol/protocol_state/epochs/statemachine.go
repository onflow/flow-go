// StateMachine implements a low-level interface for state-changing operations on the Epoch state.

// evolves the state based on the relevant information in the child block (specifically Service Events
// sealed in the child block and the child block's view). A separate instance must be created for each
// block that is being processed. Calling `Build()` constructs a snapshot of the resulting Epoch state.
