// StateMachine implements a low-level interface for state-changing operations on the Epoch state.
// It is used by higher level logic to coordinate the Epoch handover, evolving its internal state
// when Epoch-related Service Events are sealed or specific view-thresholds are reached.
//
// The StateMachine is fork-aware, in that it starts with the Epoch state of the parent block and
// evolves the state, based on the relevant information in the child block (specifically Service Events
// sealed in the child block and the child block's view). A separate instance must be created for each
// block that is being processed. Calling `Build()` constructs a snapshot of the resulting Epoch state.
//
// IMPORTANCE of the FinalizationSafetyThreshold:
// The FinalizationSafetyThreshold's value `t` acts as a deadline for sealing the EpochCommit service
// event near the end of each epoch. Specifically, if the current epoch N's final view is `f`, the
// EpochCommit event for configuring epoch N+1 must be received at latest by the:
//
//	Epoch Commitment Deadline: d=f-t
//
//	                  Epoch Commitment Deadline
//	EPOCH N           ↓                            EPOCH N+1
//	...---------------|--------------------------| |-----...
//	                  ↑                          ↑ ↑
//	view:             d············t············>⋮ f+1
//
// This deadline is used to determine when to trigger Epoch Fallback Mode [EFM]:
// if no valid configuration for epoch N+1 has been determined by view `d`, the
// protocol enters EFM for the following reason:
//   - By the time a node surpasses the last view `f` of epoch N, it must know the leaders
//     for every view of epoch N+1.
//   - The leader selection for epoch N+1 is only unambiguously determined, if the configuration
//     for epoch N+1 has been finalized. (Otherwise, different forks could contain different
//     consensus committees for epoch N+1, which would lead to different leaders. Only finalization
//     resolves this ambiguity by finalizing one and orphaning epoch configurations possibly
//     contained in competing forks).
//   - The latest point where we could still finalize a configuration for Epoch N+1 is the last view
//     `f` of epoch N. As finalization is permitted to take up to `t` views, a valid configuration
//     for epoch N+1 must be available at latest by view d=f-t.
//
// Example: A service event is emitted during the computation of block A. The execution result
// for block A, denoted as `RA`, is incorporated into block B. The seal `SA` for this result
// is included in block C:
//
//	A ← B(RA) ← C(SA) ← ... ← R
//
// A service event σ is considered sealed w.r.t. a reference block R if:
//   - σ was emitted during execution of some block A, s.t. A is an ancestor of R
//   - The seal for block A was included in some block C, s.t C is an ancestor of R
//
// When we finalize the first block B with B.View >= d:
//   - HAPPY PATH: If an EpochCommit service event has been sealed w.r.t. B, no action is taken.
//   - FALLBACK PATH: If no EpochCommit service event has been sealed w.r.t. B,
//     Epoch Fallback Mode [EFM] is triggered.
//
// CONTEXT:
// The Epoch Commitment Deadline exists to ensure that all nodes agree on whether EFM is triggered
// for a particular epoch, before the epoch actually ends. In particular, all nodes will agree about
// EFM being triggered (or not) if at least one block with view in [d, f] is finalized - in other words,
// we require at least one block being finalized after the epoch commitment deadline, and before the next
// epoch begins.
//
// It should be noted that we are employing a heuristic here, which succeeds with overwhelming probability
// of nearly 1. However, theoretically it is possible that no blocks are finalized within t views. In this
// edge case, the nodes would have not detected the epoch commit phase failing and the protocol would just
// halt at the end of the epoch. However, we emphasize that this is extremely unlikely, because the
// probability of randomly selecting t faulty leaders in sequence decays to zero exponentially with
// increasing t. Furthermore, failing to finalize blocks for a noticeable period entails halting block sealing,
// which would trigger human intervention on much smaller time scales than t views. Therefore, t should be
// chosen such that it takes more than 30mins to pass t views under happy path operation. Significant larger
// values are ok, but t views equalling 30 mins should be seen as a lower bound.
