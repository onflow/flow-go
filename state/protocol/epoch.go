	// must have a previous epoch for all epochs except that immediately after
	// the root block - in other words, if a previous epoch exists, implementations
	// must arrange to expose it here.

// different forks, since the emission of service events is fork-dependent.
// Therefore, an epoch exists RELATIVE to the snapshot from which it was
// queried.

// CAUTION: Clients must ensure to query epochs only for finalized blocks to
// ensure they query finalized epoch information.
//
// An Epoch instance is constant and reports the identical information
// even if progress is made later and more information becomes available in
// subsequent blocks.
//
// Methods error if epoch preparation has not progressed far enough for
// this information to be determined by a finalized block.
