// RandomBeaconSafetyThreshold defines a production network safety threshold for random beacon protocol based on the size
// of the random beacon committee ℛ and the DKG committee 𝒟.
//
// We recall that the committee ℛ is defined as the subset of the consensus committee (ℛ ⊆ 𝒞) and the DKG
// committee (ℛ ⊆ 𝒟) that _successfully_ completed the DKG and is able to contribute with a random beacon share.
//
// An honest supermajority of consensus nodes must contain enough successful DKG participants
// (about |𝒟|/2 + 1) to produce a valid group signature for the random beacon at each block [1, 3].
// Therefore, we have the approximate lower bound |ℛ| ≳ n/2 + 1 = |𝒟|/2 + 1 = len(DKGIndexMap)/2 + 1.
// Operating close to this lower bound would require that every random beacon key-holder ϱ ∈ ℛ remaining in the consensus committee is honest
// (incl. quickly responsive) *all the time*. Such a reliability assumption is unsuited for decentralized production networks.
// To reject configurations that are vulnerable to liveness failures, the protocol uses the threshold `t_safety`
// (heuristic, see [2]), which is implemented on the smart contract level.
// Ideally, |ℛ| and therefore |𝒟 ∩ 𝒞| (given that |ℛ| <= |𝒟 ∩ 𝒞|) should be well above 70% . |𝒟|.
// Values in the range 70%-62% of |𝒟| should be considered for short-term recovery cases.
// Values of 62% * |𝒟| or lower (i.e. |ℛ| ≤ 0.62·|𝒟|) are not recommended for any
// production network, as single-node crashes may already be enough to halt consensus.
