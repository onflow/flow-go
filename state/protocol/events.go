// Consumer defines a set of events that occur within the protocol state, that
// can be propagated to other components via an implementation of this interface.
// Collectively, these are referred to as "Protocol Events".
//
// Protocol events are delivered immediately after the database transaction
// committing the corresponding state change completes successfully.
// This means that events are delivered exactly once, while the system is running.
// Events may not be delivered during crashes and restarts, but any missed events
// are guaranteed to be reflected in the Protocol State upon restarting.
// Components consuming protocol events which cannot tolerate missed events
// must implement initialization logic which accounts for any missed events.
//
// EXAMPLE:
// Suppose block A is finalized at height 100. If the BlockFinalized(A) event is
// dropped due to a crash, then when the node restarts, the latest finalized block
// in the Protocol State is guaranteed to be A.
//
// CAUTION: Protocol event subscriber callbacks are invoked synchronously in the
// critical path of protocol state mutations. Most subscribers should immediately
// spawn a goroutine to handle the notification to avoid blocking protocol state
// progression, especially for frequent protocol events (eg. BlockFinalized).
//
// NOTE: the epoch-related callbacks are only called once the fork containing
// the relevant event has been finalized.

	// BlockProcessable is called when a correct block is encountered that is

	// its source of randomness is available). BlockProcessable is never emitted
	// for the root block, as the root block is always processable.
