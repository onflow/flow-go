// Consumer defines a set of events that occur within the protocol state, that
// can be propagated to other components via an implementation of this interface.
// Collectively, these are referred to as "Protocol Events".
//
// Protocol events are guaranteed to be delivered at least once. Subscribers must
// handle multiple deliveries.
//
// CAUTION: Protocol event subscriber callbacks are invoked synchronously in the
// critical path of protocol state mutations. Most subscribers should immediately
// spawn a goroutine to handle the notification to avoid blocking protocol state
// progression, especially for frequent protocol events (eg. BlockFinalized).
//
// NOTE: the epoch-related callbacks are only called once the fork containing
// the relevant event has been finalized.

	// that is ready to be processed (i.e. it is connected to the finalized
	// chain and its source of randomness is available).
