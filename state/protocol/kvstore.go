// This file contains versioned read interface to the Protocol State's
// key-value store and are used by the Protocol State Machine.
//
// When a key is added or removed, this requires a new protocol state version:
//  - Create a new versioned model in ./protocol_state/kvstore/models.go (eg. modelv3 if latest model is modelv2)
//  - Update the KVStoreReader and protocol_state.KVStoreAPI interfaces to include any new keys

// KVStoreReader is the latest read-only interface to the Protocol State key-value store
// at a particular block.
//
// Caution:
// Engineers evolving this interface must ensure that it is backwards-compatible
// with all versions of Protocol State Snapshots that can be retrieved from the local
// database, which should exactly correspond to the versioned model types defined in
// ./kvstore/models.go

	// Version defines the key-value store's data model (specifically, the set of all keys
	// and the respective type for each corresponding value).
	// Generally, changes in the protocol state version correspond to changes in the set
	// of key-value pairs which are supported, and which model is used for serialization.

	// with a past view if the upgrade has already been activated.
