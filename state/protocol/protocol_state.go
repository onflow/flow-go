// StateMutator is a stateful object to evolve the protocol state. It is instantiated from the parent block's protocol state.
// State-changing operations can be iteratively applied and the StateMutator will internally evolve its in-memory state.
// While the StateMutator does not modify the database, it internally tracks the necessary database updates to persist its
// dependencies (specifically EpochSetup and EpochCommit events). Upon calling `Build` the StateMutator returns the updated
// protocol state, its ID and all database updates necessary for persisting the updated protocol state.
//
// The StateMutator is used by a replica's compliance layer to update protocol state when observing state-changing service in
// blocks. It is used by the primary in the block building process to obtain the correct protocol state for a proposal.
// Specifically, the leader may include state-changing service events in the block payload. The flow protocol prescribes that
// the proposal needs to include the ID of the protocol state, _after_ processing the payload incl. all state-changing events.
// Therefore, the leader instantiates a StateMutator, applies the service events to it and builds the updated protocol state ID.

	//   - dbUpdates: database updates necessary for persisting the updated protocol state's *dependencies*.
	//     If hasChanges is false, updatedState is empty. Caution: persisting the `updatedState` itself and adding
	//     it to the relevant indices is _not_ in `dbUpdates`. Persisting and indexing `updatedState` is the responsibility
	//     of the calling code (specifically `FollowerState`).

	// ApplyServiceEventsFromValidatedSeals applies the state changes that are delivered via
	// sealed service events:
	//   - iterating over the sealed service events in order of increasing height
	//   - identifying state-changing service event and calling into the embedded
	//     ProtocolStateMachine to apply the respective state update
	//   - tracking deferred database updates necessary to persist the updated
	//     protocol state's *dependencies*. Persisting and indexing `updatedState`
	//     is the responsibility of the calling code (specifically `FollowerState`)
	//
	// All updates only mutate the `StateMutator`'s internal in-memory copy of the
	// protocol state, without changing the parent state (i.e. the state we started from).
	//
	// SAFETY REQUIREMENT:
	// The StateMutator assumes that the proposal has passed the following correctness checks!
	//   - The seals in the payload continuously follow the ancestry of this fork. Specifically,
	//     there are no gaps in the seals.
	//   - The seals guarantee correctness of the sealed execution result, including the contained
	//     service events. This is actively checked by the verification node, whose aggregated
	//     approvals in the form of a seal attest to the correctness of the sealed execution result,
	//     including the contained.
	//
	// Consensus nodes actively verify protocol compliance for any block proposal they receive,
	// including integrity of each seal individually as well as the seals continuously following the
	// fork. Light clients only process certified blocks, which guarantees that consensus nodes already
	// ran those checks and found the proposal to be valid.
	//
	// Details on SERVICE EVENTS:
	// Consider a chain where a service event is emitted during execution of block A.
	// Block B contains an execution receipt for A. Block C contains a seal for block
	// A's execution result.
	//
	//	A <- .. <- B(RA) <- .. <- C(SA)
	//
	// Service Events are included within execution results, which are stored
	// opaquely as part of the block payload in block B. We only validate, process and persist
	// the typed service event to storage once we process C, the block containing the
	// seal for block A. This is because we rely on the sealing subsystem to validate
	// correctness of the service event before processing it.
	// Consequently, any change to the protocol state introduced by a service event
	// emitted during execution of block A would only become visible when querying
	// C or its descendants.
	//
	// Error returns:
	//   - Per convention, the input seals from the block payload have already confirmed to be protocol compliant.
	//     Hence, the service events in the sealed execution results represent the honest execution path.
	//     Therefore, the sealed service events should encode a valid evolution of the protocol state -- provided
	//     the system smart contracts are correct.
	//   - As we can rule out byzantine attacks as the source of failures, the only remaining sources of problems
	//     can be (a) bugs in the system smart contracts or (b) bugs in the node implementation.
	//     A service event not representing a valid state transition despite all consistency checks passing
	//     is interpreted as case (a) and handled internally within the StateMutator. In short, we go into Epoch
	//     Fallback Mode by copying the parent state (a valid state snapshot) and setting the
	//     `InvalidEpochTransitionAttempted` flag. All subsequent Epoch-lifecycle events are ignored.
	//   - A consistency or sanity check failing within the StateMutator is likely the symptom of an internal bug
	//     in the node software or state corruption, i.e. case (b). This is the only scenario where the error return
	//     of this function is not nil. If such an exception is returned, continuing is not an option.
