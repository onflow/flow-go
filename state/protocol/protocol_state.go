// MutableProtocolState is the read-write interface for protocol state. It allows evolving the protocol

type MutableProtocolState interface {
	ProtocolState

	// EvolveState updates the overall Protocol State based on information in the candidate block
	// (potentially still under construction). Information that may change the state is:
	//   - the candidate block's view
	//   - Service Events from execution results sealed in the candidate block
	//
	// EvolveState is compatible with speculative processing: it evolves an *in-memory copy* of the parent state
	// and collects *deferred database updates* for persisting the resulting Protocol State, including all of its
	// dependencies and respective indices. Though, the resulting batch of deferred database updates still depends
	// on the candidate block's ID, which is still unknown at the time of block construction. Executing the deferred
	// database updates is the caller's responsibility.
	//
	// SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
	//  1. The seals must be a protocol-compliant extension of the parent block. Intuitively, we require that the
	//     seals follow the ancestry of this fork without gaps. The Consensus Participant's Compliance Layer enforces
	//     the necessary constrains. Analogously, the block building logic should always produce protocol-compliant
	//     seals.
	//     The seals guarantee correctness of the sealed execution result, including the contained service events.
	//     This is actively checked by the verification node, whose aggregated approvals in the form of a seal attest
	//     to the correctness of the sealed execution result (specifically the Service Events contained in the result
	//     and their order).
	//  2. For Consensus Participants that are replicas, the calling code must check that the returned `stateID` matches
	//     the commitment in the block proposal! If they don't match, the proposer is byzantine and should be slashed.
	//
	// Consensus nodes actively verify protocol compliance for any block proposal they receive, including integrity of
	// each seal individually as well as the seals continuously following the fork. Light clients only process certified
	// blocks, which guarantees that consensus nodes already ran those checks and found the proposal to be valid.
	//
	// SERVICE EVENTS form an order-preserving, asynchronous, one-way message bus from the System Smart Contracts
	// (verified honest execution) to the Protocol State. For example, consider a fork where a service event is
	// emitted during execution of block A. Block B contains an execution receipt `RA` for A. Block C holds a
	// seal `SA` for A's execution result.
	//
	//    A ← … ← B(RA) ← … ← C(SA)
	//
	// Service Events are included within execution results, which are stored opaquely as part of the block payload
	// (block B in our example). Though, to ensure correctness of the service events, we only process them upon sealing.
	// There is some non-deterministic delay when the Protocol State observes the Service Events from block A.
	// In our example, any change to the protocol state requested by the system smart contracts in block A, would only
	// become visible in block C's Protocol State (and descendants).
	//
	// Error returns:
	// [TLDR] All error returns indicate potential state corruption and should therefore be treated as fatal.
	//   - Per convention, the input seals from the block payload have already been confirmed to be protocol compliant.
	//     Hence, the service events in the sealed execution results represent the honest execution path.
	//     Therefore, the sealed service events should encode a valid evolution of the protocol state -- provided
	//     the system smart contracts are correct.
	//   - As we can rule out byzantine attacks as the source of failures, the only remaining sources of problems
	//     can be (a) bugs in the system smart contracts or (b) bugs in the node implementation. A service event
	//     not representing a valid state transition despite all consistency checks passing is interpreted as
	//     case (a) and _should be_ handled internally by the respective state machine. Otherwise, any bug or
	//     unforeseen edge cases in the system smart contracts would result in consensus halt, due to errors while
	//     evolving the protocol state.
	//   - A consistency or sanity check failing within the StateMutator is likely the symptom of an internal bug
	//     in the node software or state corruption, i.e. case (b). This is the only scenario where the error return
	//     of this function is not nil. If such an exception is returned, continuing is not an option.
