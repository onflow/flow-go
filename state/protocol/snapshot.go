// Snapshot represents an immutable snapshot of the protocol state
// at a specific block, denoted as the Head block.
// The Snapshot is fork-specific and only accounts for the information contained
// in blocks along this fork up to (including) Head.
// It allows us to read the parameters at the selected block in a deterministic manner.
//
// TODO Epoch / Snapshot API Structure:  Currently Epoch and Snapshot APIs
// are structured to allow chained queries to be used without error checking
// at each call where errors might occur. Instead, errors are cached in the
// resulting struct (eg. invalid.Epoch) until the query chain ends with a
// function which can return an error. This has some negative effects:
//  1. Cached intermediary errors result in more complex error handling
//     a) each final call of the chained query needs to handle all intermediary errors, every time
//     b) intermediary errors must be handled by dependencies on the final call of the query chain (eg. conversion functions)
//  2. The error caching pattern encourages potentially dangerous snapshot query patterns
//
// See https://github.com/dapperlabs/flow-go/issues/6368 for details and proposal
//
// A snapshot with an unknown reference block will return state.ErrUnknownSnapshotReference for all methods.

	// Head returns the latest block at the selected point of the protocol state

	// we should build the next block in the context of the selected state.
	// TODO document error returns
	Head() (*flow.Header, error)

	// QuorumCertificate returns a valid quorum certificate for the header at
	// this snapshot, if one exists.
	// Expected error returns:
	//   - storage.ErrNotFound is returned if the QC is unknown.
	//   - state.ErrUnknownSnapshotReference if the snapshot reference block is unknown
	// All other errors should be treated as exceptions.
	QuorumCertificate() (*flow.QuorumCertificate, error)

	// Identities returns a list of identities at the selected point of the
	// protocol state history. At the beginning of an epoch, this list includes
	// identities from the previous epoch that are un-staking during the current
	// epoch. At the end of an epoch, this includes identities scheduled to join
	// in the next epoch but are not active yet.
	//
	// Identities are guaranteed to be returned in canonical order (order.Canonical).
	//
	// It allows us to provide optional upfront filters which can be used by the

	// SealedResult returns the most recent included seal as of this block and
	// the corresponding execution result. The seal may have been included in a
	// parent block, if this block is empty. If this block contains multiple
	// seals, this returns the seal for the block with the greatest height.

	// Commit returns the state commitment of the most recently included seal
	// as of this block. It represents the sealed state.

	// SealingSegment returns the chain segment such that the highest block
	// is this snapshot's reference block and the lowest block
	// is the most recently sealed block as of this snapshot (ie. the block
	// referenced by LatestSeal). The segment is in ascending height order.
	//
	// TAIL <- B1 <- ... <- BN <- HEAD
	//
	// NOTE 1: TAIL is not always sealed by HEAD. In the case that the head of
	// the snapshot contains no seals, TAIL must be sealed by the first ancestor
	// of HEAD which contains any seal.
	//
	// NOTE 2: In the special case of a root snapshot generated for a spork,
	// the sealing segment has exactly one block (the root block for the spork).
	// For all other snapshots, the sealing segment contains at least 2 blocks.
	//
	// NOTE 3: It is often the case that a block inside the segment will contain
	// an execution receipt in its payload that references an execution result
	// missing from the payload. These missing execution results are stored on the
	// flow.SealingSegment.ExecutionResults field.
	// Expected errors during normal operations:
	//  - protocol.ErrSealingSegmentBelowRootBlock if sealing segment would stretch beyond the node's local history cut-off
	//  - protocol.UnfinalizedSealingSegmentError if sealing segment would contain unfinalized blocks (including orphaned blocks)
	//  - state.ErrUnknownSnapshotReference if the snapshot reference block is unknown
	SealingSegment() (*flow.SealingSegment, error)

	// Descendants returns the IDs of all descendants of the Head block.
	// The IDs are ordered such that parents are included before their children.
	// Since all blocks are fully validated before being inserted to the state,
	// all returned blocks are validated.
	// No errors are expected under normal operation.
	Descendants() ([]flow.Identifier, error)

	// RandomSource returns the source of randomness _for_ the snapshot's Head block.
	// Note that the source of randomness for a block `H`, is contained in the
	// QuorumCertificate [QC] for block `H` (QCs for H are distributed as part of child
	// blocks, timeout messages or timeout certificates). While there might be different
	// QCs for block H, they all yield exactly the same source of randomness (feature of
	// threshold signatures used here). Therefore, it is a possibility that there is no
	// QC known (yet) for the head block.
	// NOTE: not to be confused with the epoch source of randomness!
	// Expected error returns:
	//  - storage.ErrNotFound is returned if the QC is unknown.
	//  - state.ErrUnknownSnapshotReference if the snapshot reference block is unknown
	// All other errors should be treated as exceptions.

	// Phase returns the epoch phase for the current epoch, as of the Head block.
	// TODO document error returns
	Phase() (flow.EpochPhase, error)

	// Epochs returns a query object enabling querying detailed information about
	// various epochs.
	//
	// For epochs that are in the future w.r.t. the Head block, some of Epoch's
	// methods may return errors, since the Epoch Preparation Protocol may be
	// in-progress and incomplete for the epoch.
	// Returns invalid.Epoch with state.ErrUnknownSnapshotReference if snapshot reference block is unknown.

	// VersionBeacon returns the latest sealed version beacon.
	// If no version beacon has been sealed so far during the current spork, returns nil.
	// The latest VersionBeacon is only updated for finalized blocks. This means that, when
	// querying an un-finalized fork, `VersionBeacon` will have the same value as querying
	// the snapshot for the latest finalized block, even if a newer version beacon is included
	// in a seal along the un-finalized fork.
