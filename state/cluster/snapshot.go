	Collection() (*flow.Collection, error)

	// this snapshot. Technically, this is the header of a [cluster.Block]

	// The result is ordered such that parents are included before their children. While only valid
	// descendants will be returned, note that the descendants may not be finalized yet.
	//
	// CAUTION: the list of descendants is constructed for each call via database reads,
	// and may be expensive to compute, especially if the reference collection is older.
