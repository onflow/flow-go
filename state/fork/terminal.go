// Terminal specifies the terminal condition for traversing a fork. It abstracts
// the precise termination condition for `TraverseBackward` and `TraverseForward`.
// Generally, when traversing a fork (in either direction), there are two distinct
// blocks:
//  * the `head` of the fork that should be traversed
//  * the `lowestBlock` in that fork, which should be included in the traversal
// The traversal the walks `head <--> lowestBlock` (in either direction).
//
// There are a variety of ways to precisely specify `head` and `lowestBlock`:
//  * At least one block, `head` or `lowestBlock`, must be specified by its ID
//    to unambiguously identify the fork that should be traversed.
//  * The other block an either be specified by ID or height.
//  * If both `head` and `lowestBlock` are specified by their ID,
//    they must both be on the same fork.
// Essentially it converts the termination condition into two statements:
//   (i) The height of the lowest block that should be visited.
//  (ii) A consistency check `ConfirmTerminalReached` for the lowest visited block.
//       This check is predominantly useful in case both `head` and `lowestBlock`
//       are specified by their ID. It allows to enforce that `head` and `lowestBlock`
//       are both on the same fork and error otherwise.
//       However, the precise implementation of `ConfirmTerminalReached` is left to
//       the Terminal. Other, more elaborate conditions are possible.
