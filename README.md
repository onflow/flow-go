# Flow [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/onflow/flow-go?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/onflow/flow-go)

Flow is a fast, secure, and developer-friendly blockchain built to support the
next generation of games, apps and the digital assets that power them. Read more
about it [here](https://github.com/onflow/flow).

## Getting started

- To install all dependencies and tools, see the [project setup](#installation) guide
- To dig into more documentation about Flow, see the [documentation](#documentation)
- To learn how to contribute, see the [contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- To see information on developing Flow, see the [development workflow](#development-workflow)

## Documentation

You can find an overview of the Flow architecture on the [documentation website](https://www.onflow.org/primer).

Development on Flow is divided into work streams. Each work stream has a home
directory containing high-level documentation for the stream, as well as links
to documentation for relevant components used by that work stream.

The following table lists all work streams and links to their home directory and documentation:

| Work Stream       | Home directory                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Access Node       | [/cmd/access](/cmd/access)                 |
| Collection Node   | [/cmd/collection](/cmd/collection)      |
| Consensus Node    | [/cmd/consensus](/cmd/consensus)        |
| Execution Node    | [/cmd/execution](/cmd/execution)     |
| Verification Node | [/cmd/verification](/cmd/verification)     |
| HotStuff          | [/consensus/hotstuff](/consensus/hotstuff) |
| Storage           | [/storage](/storage)                       |
| Ledger            | [/ledger](/ledger)                         |
| Networking        | [/network](/network/)                      |
| Cryptography      | [/crypto](/crypto)                         |

## Installation

### Clone Repository

- Clone this repository
- Clone this repository's submodules:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

### Install Dependencies

- Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (Flow supports Go 1.16 and later)
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/), which is used for building the crypto library
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), which is used for running
  a local network and integration tests
- Make sure the [`GOPATH`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable) and `GOBIN` environment variables are set, and `GOBIN` is added to your path:

    ```bash
    export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
    export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
    ```

  Add these to your shell profile to persist them for future runs.
- Then, run the following command:

    ```bash
    make install-tools
    ```

At this point, you should be ready to build, test, and run Flow! ðŸŽ‰

Note: if there is error about "relic" or "crypto", trying force removing the relic build and reinstall the tools again:

```bash
rm -rf crypto/relic
make install-tools
```

## Development Workflow

### Testing

Flow has a unit test suite and an integration test suite. Unit tests for a module
live within the module they are testing. Integration tests live in `integration/tests`.

Run the unit test suite:

```bash
make test
```

Run the integration test suite:

```bash
make integration-test
```

### Building

The recommended way to build and run Flow for local development is using Docker.

Build a Docker image for all nodes:

```bash
make docker-build-flow
```

Build a Docker image for a particular node role (replace `$ROLE` with `collection`, `consensus`, etc.):

```bash
make docker-build-$ROLE
```

### Local Network

A local version of the network can be run for manual testing and integration.
See the [Local Network Guide](/integration/localnet/README.md) for instructions.

### Code Generation

Generated code is kept up to date in the repository, so should be committed whenever it changes.

Run all code generators:

```bash
make generate
```

Generate protobuf stubs:

```bash
make generate-proto
```

Generate mocks used for unit tests:

```bash
make generate-mocks
```
